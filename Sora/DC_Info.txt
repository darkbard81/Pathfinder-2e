Photorealistic vertical 3:2 portrait — From directly overhead, the scene reads like a patchwork of sky-light and ocean hues, framing a slim, petite young woman with a large, natural, slightly uneven bust. She reclines deeply in the open Ferris-wheel gondola’s cushioned, deep-set chair on a bright seaside afternoon, her back leaning all the way back, nearly horizontal, with the gondola.

She has an angular face with high, prominent cheekbones and a sharp jawline, lending her an ethereal, sculpted look. Her nearly translucent skin reveals faint blue veins beneath, with visible micro-pores and a few faint laugh lines around her eyes. Specular highlights shine on her forehead center, nose bridge, nose tip, and cheekbones. Her back features an expensive spine tattoo.

Her sleek black bob, cut to 25 cm, features wispy strands softening her features, with 8–10 fine, semi-transparent baby hairs framing her hairline and temples, fanning out across the cushioned chair.

Her striking brown eyes, almond-shaped with a slight upward tilt at the outer corners, are framed by long, pale lashes that blend with her fair complexion. Two pinpoint catch-lights shine at 10 o’clock and 2 o’clock in each eye. Her eyebrows are thin, arching subtly, with 3–4 stray hairs above each arch.

Her Small, straight nose with softly raised bridge and hidden nostril, pale pink lips with a defined Cupid’s bow. She wears a warm, inviting half-smile, her mouth slightly opened, softly parting her lips to subtly reveal ivory teeth, outer lip corners lifted exactly 2 mm, creating a tiny dimple on her right cheek.

A smattering of small metallic accents—a single stud nestled in one ear, a delicate ring at the side of her nose, and hints of others in discreet, hidden spots—catches the light with a soft gleam. She also wears small gold hoop earrings, each showing a tiny bright glint. Around her neck rests a black lace choker necklace, from which hangs a small silver crescent-moon pendant.

Her face—only 20–30 cm from the lens—fills the upper half of the frame as she looks directly into the camera with laughter-soft creases at the corners of her eyes.

She wears a pale-copper-clear cropped top with whisper-thin straps slipped from both shoulders, leaving the cropped top to settle low across the bust belt-like, while high-waisted, charcoal-grey yoga leggings cling like a second skin—each vertical rib in the fabric visible as it traces the narrow curve of her waist before blossoming over exceptionally rounded, sculpted glutes. The waistband, about four centimetres wide, tucks in sharply at her midriff and then releases into the full sweep of her hips, giving her figure a sculptural hourglass balance. Fine pink glitter lightly dusts the bust, subtly visible as it catches sunbeams along its full outer rim curve.
