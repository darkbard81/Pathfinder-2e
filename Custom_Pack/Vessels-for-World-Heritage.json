{"campaignID":"e143c83d-227c-484d-aba9-74e67f8a0677","campaignName":"Vessels for World Heritage","campaignDescription":"The world is slowly heading toward its end due to a decline in birthrates.  \nThere is only one last method to prevent annihilation ― to carry on new bloodlines.  \n\nYou are the chosen **Seedbearer**, and all the world’s **Vessels** are destined to bear your seed.  \nHumans, fey, monsters, even divine beings are no exception.  \nEvery female-shaped creature must inherit your lineage, for that is the path to preserving the world’s heritage.  \n\nIn this campaign, there is only one PC.  \nAll NPCs are female: companions, enemies, even captured monsters eventually become **Vessels**.  \nCombat and union are two sides of the same coin ― fight, dominate, and plant your seed to forge the future of the world.
