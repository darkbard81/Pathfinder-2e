# Pathbuilder2e Custom Pack & Campaign

## Vessels for World Heritage
>The world is slowly heading toward its end due to a decline in birthrates.  
There is only one last method to prevent annihilation ― to carry on new bloodlines.  

>You are the chosen **Seedbearer**, and all the world’s **Vessels** are destined to bear your seed.  
Humans, fey, monsters, even divine beings are no exception.  
Every female-shaped creature must inherit your lineage, for that is the path to preserving the world’s heritage.  

>In this campaign, there is only one PC.  
All NPCs are female: companions, enemies, even captured monsters eventually become **Vessels**.  
Combat and union are two sides of the same coin ― fight, dominate, and plant your seed to forge the future of the world.  

### Absolute Law of the Seedbearer
>No matter mortal or monster, spirit or shadow, even god or concept itself ―
once the Humanoid Trait manifests, it shall become a Vessel.
And every Vessel shall bear the Seedbearer’s legacy.
