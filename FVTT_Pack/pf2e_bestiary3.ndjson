A giant vulture has a wingspan of up to 25 feet across and weighs up to 600 pounds. Less common than their smaller cousins, they typically live in areas that support a number of megafauna species. While imposing and certainly dangerous when provoked, even giant vultures are not hostile by nature, preferring to feast on the kills of others. They are more likely to vomit their last meal as a distraction while they flee than to attack other creatures.

The sturdy mainspring within a clockwork must be wound to provide the energy needed to power the device. Some larger clockworks contain a series of springs for different limbs that each need to be wound. A clockwork's crafter creates a unique metal key while building the clockwork; winding the clockwork usually involves inserting the key into the machine's back and turning clockwise. Larger clockworks require greater strength to turn the key, and typically have larger keys to allow for more torque-some even accommodating a team of winders rather than an individual. Programming a clockwork requires both the key and the knowledge to set the program correctly, information usually reserved for the clockwork's creator or owner."}

A mortal who shows a shae their due deference is worth keeping around, so many shae collect cults of personality or expansive entourages. Even getting a meeting with such a self-important shae can present a challenge that requires one to deal with many layers of hangers-on who insist on vetting the new"}

The sturdy mainspring within a clockwork must be wound to provide the energy needed to power the device. Some larger clockworks contain a series of springs for different limbs that each need to be wound. A clockwork's crafter creates a unique metal key while building the clockwork; winding the clockwork usually involves inserting the key into the machine's back and turning clockwise. Larger clockworks require greater strength to turn the key, and typically have larger keys to allow for more torque-some even accommodating a team of winders rather than an individual.

While their pixie and grig cousins are most common, numerous additional types of sprites were born from the faerie realm of the First World. These include draxies, melixies, and nykteras, each of which shares commonalities with a different animal or magical creature."}

While a pangolin's defenses serve well against natural predators, they've long been targets of poaching by humanoid cultures, partly for meat, but largely due to the high value of their unique scales. These scales see widespread use in alchemy, folk medicine, and crafting, and thus demand for them-and the associated profits from their sale-remain high. Giant pangolins are better protected against humanoid hunters, but the larger size of their scales means wider applications and greater volume.

Given their remarkable stature, a megalictis can take down sizable prey, including horses and even the occasional bear, if the opportunity presents itself. A megalictis can grow to be 5 feet long and weighs around 150 pounds. Weasels are lithe, clever predators known for both their beautiful, sleek fur and their ability to crawl into tight spaces. Pound for pound, few animals are as voracious as weasels. Insatiably hungry, they eat almost half their own weight each day, leading them to constantly hunt for new prey to satisfy their hunger."}

They propagate by luring a humanoid away from the shelter of their home and slowly transforming the kidnapped creature into a new kushtaka. Kushtaka have an easier time transforming willing prey, so they prefer to use their shapeshifting ability and innate magical powers to convince their chosen targets to follow them away to a kushtaka village. Once a humanoid has been lured to a kushtaka village, they slowly begin to change, a bit at a time, until their body transforms fully into that of a kushtaka and ejects their mortal soul. These ejected souls often linger before giving rise to ghosts or haunts, though the kushtaka themselves are unaware of the souls' presence, having completely forgotten who they once were due to the magic that transformed them. Kushtaka can be a scourge to small human villages, slowly pilfering villagers away one person at a time. This might mean the kushtaka village displaces the human one, or leaves the human village unable to survive with too small a population to hunt, fish, defend against threats, or raise the next generation."}

Intricate, complex machines, clockworks are built with care by highly skilled engineers. Though their creation involves some amount of magic, they're primarily mechanical, packed with precision-tuned gears and springs working in concert. The sturdy mainspring within a clockwork must be wound to provide the energy needed to power the device. Some larger clockworks contain a series of springs for different limbs that each need to be wound. A clockwork's crafter creates a unique metal key while building the clockwork; winding the clockwork usually involves inserting the key into the machine's back and turning clockwise. Larger clockworks require greater strength to turn the key, and typically have larger keys to allow for more torque-some even ac"}

As if numerous claws and a brutal bite weren't concerning enough, these nightmare-inducing creatures can be wickedly deceptive, luring their prey out in winter storms.

They are more interested in hunting and killing their next meal than forming alliances. For all their disregard of others' opinions, cave giants are cautious when it comes to defending territory. Cave giant traps are simple yet effective, such as rounded boulders that can be pushed down steep tunnels, camouflaged pits filled with sharpened stakes, and even compromised stalactites that can suddenly fall on unsuspecting intruders. In coastal towns and hillside villages with caves a common feature of the landscape, cave giants star as common villains in local tall tales. Many youngsters and aspiring heroes dare one another to venture into remote grottoes or abandoned mine shafts in the hopes of discovering a cave giant, and all too often their searches prove successful.

The refuse moves in one giant mass, its skin blackened and crispy, leaving a trail of dripping grease and gravy. Its body is perpetually steaming hot, as though fresh from the pot, fat popping and sizzling. Squirming swills wander kitchens, sewers, swamps, midden pits, and grimy city canals. With little intelligence and no agenda, they come after any creature that remotely resembles the one who stewed them-usually, anything humanoid will do. Most swills try immediately to kill the creature, but some approach longingly, as though reuniting with a lost parent. They also seem to show sympathy or fellowship to other small animals. Unfortunately, their grotesque scent or the heat of their touch tends to scare away the living. Handily, the squirming swill is just as happy to befriend a small animal's co"}

But after sunset, the creature sheds her skin, hides it in a safe place, and stalks the night to drink the blood that sustains her.

These colonies pose great danger to any adventurer foolish enough to approach.

The musk of the megatherium serves as a warning to potential predators and other megatheriums that they're too close.

Though the creatures regularly patrol their territory for intruders, they tend to avoid settlements unless food has become scarce. When they do stray into towns, they've been known to devour entire orchards in a day. Despite their long, hooked claws being one of their most distinctive features, sloths are herbivorous creatures.

An individual colony typically takes on distinctive properties based on what it's consumed in its environment; a variety living in a necromancer's crypt might acquire the undead"}

Strength takes many forms, some evident in their power-like the feathered bear-and some unassuming. Spirit guides are a distinctive form of spiritual entity with a tenuous attachment to the Material Plane. Some legends say that the first spirit guides were the perfect conceptual forms of animals, and that from them, eagles, foxes, bears, and other mortal animals were born. Each guide displayed an interest in mortal affairs, watching over communities and imparting their gifts. Fox shared his cunning with the mortals he befriended, while Bear taught them how to survive and endure.

On Golarion, they found a great cataclysm had blocked out the sun behind a cloud of smoke and ash, enshrouding the planet in a seemingly endless night, and here they made their new home.

Absorbing such information destabilizes their corporeal form, like when books are stacked too high, so excess knowledge seeps from a caulborn's body, causing a literal brain drain that caulborn find incredibly vexing. To avoid this occurrence, caulborn must feed on others' psychic energy to maintain themselves, which is usually a harmless process. Especially hungry caulborn even abduct prey. Despite their need to feed, caulborn rarely care to interact with other creatures, especially beings that could react to their appearance with fear or hostility. They occasionally make exceptions for accomplished scholars or storied travelers, however, bartering their o"}

Rather, huldras are wardens of the woodlands they occupy. Grown from saplings by powerful forest-dwelling fey as a response to humanoid encroachment, huldras protect and parley for the forest itself. Woodland creatures adore huldras, and sometimes approach humans or elves thinking they're huldras.

Coral capuchins live in tropical climates, and while they can breathe water or air with equal ease, their membranous skin means they rely heavily on having a nearby source of water. Fresh- and saltwater serve equally well for this purpose, though the creatures generally congregate near oceans and seas for other reasons. Jungles, islands, and warm coastlines are their most common nesting sites, though they usually hide their nests high in trees or in other locations out of easy reach of predators, scavengers, or anything that might steal the trinkets they've collected. These little flyers are insatiably curious, and they love to follow humanoids around. Capuchins largely agree that humanoids have the best food and trinkets. Smarter than animals and capable of rudimentary speech, the creatures can be quite useful with the right training, learning how seek out sunken treasures or hunt down rats"}

A clockwork dragon's winding mechanism is more efficient than those of other clockworks, allowing it to partially reuse energy generated by flapping its wings. Creating a clockwork dragon requires not only an advanced understanding of clockwork design, but also a greater cache of rare resources, as its body requires solid reinforcement. As a result, most clockwork dragons have adamantine fortification. Creating a clockwork dragon without adamantine is entirely possible, though such dragons are typically smaller and more fragile. Intricate, complex machines, clockworks are built with care by highly skilled engineers. Though their creation involves some amount of magic, they're primarily mechanical, packed with precision-tuned gears and springs working in concert. The sturdy mainspring within a clockwork must be wound to provide the energy needed to power the device. Some larger clockworks contain a series of springs for different limbs that each need to be wound. A clockwork's crafter creates a unique metal key while building the clock"}

They shed their antlers come winter and grow a new set each year at a rapid rate. For most of the year, moose roam tundra, forest, and wilderness territories by themselves. Their hooves are wide, allowing them to more easily traverse the frequent snowfall of their native terrain, and they typically journey alone. Moose come together only during mating season, a time in which they become oddly social with one another, loud, and even more aggressive to other creatures than usual. A moose's diet consists of leaves, woody plant matter like twigs or bark, and buds of trees and shrubs. Moose are so large they prefer to eat the leaves of trees taller than humans instead of lowering their giant heads all the way to the ground.

Communal by nature, bison gather in large numbers for the summer mating season before the bulls split off to wander the prairie grasses.

They're then sent on to the afterlife upon becoming a myceloid meal. Eating humanoid flesh is not a necessity-a myceloid can survive on any decaying matter-but it's certainly a pleasure.
