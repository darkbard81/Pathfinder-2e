These simple creatures use their lights to draw in or disorient prey, mostly small animals like lizards, rodents, or fish. However, they might go after larger prey if trying to feed their young. When they encounter creatures their own size or larger they retreat, flashing their eyes to facilitate their escape if necessary. They often hunt in pairs or small packs. Using their lights to coordinate from a distance, they slowly close in on the creatures they hunt. One common hunting pattern involves one blindheim diving deep and using its light to chase fish to the surface, while another up above snatches them up and tosses them onto the land to eat later. Blindheims make their nests in damp caverns, especially grottoes next to underground lakes or bogs. An ideal nest rests in a cozy cavern with plenty of fungus to eat, a few fish swimming in a lake, and the comforting drip of water from the ceiling. Bl"}

When particularly excited, their eyes and petals glow with collected sunlight, and when they become depressed or saddened, their usually vibrant coloration grows correspondingly muted. These shifts in coloration are echoed in sunflower leshy art, which can lead to unexpected color palettes for artworks. For example, a human artist might illustrate Hell as a place of glowing lava and flickering flames, drawing upon many vibrant colors, but to a sunflower leshy, the only proper way to depict a place like Hell is in morose grays, blacks, and whites. The more adventurous sunflower leshys leave their communities to grow bonds with nearby settlements of humanoids. When interacting with humanoids, sunflower leshys are some of the most likely to act friendly and give strangers a chance to prove their good intentions, though they remain cautious. They're often accompanied by other, more powerful leshys."}

Since a viper vine gains nourishment by consuming creatures rather than through ingesting moisture and soil, it has developed rudimentary locomotion and can drag itself along the ground with its tentacle-like roots.

Most perytons are loners who loathe all other creatures. These feelings extend to other perytons as well, and adult males attack each other on sight as surely as they attack anything else. Once per year, perytons mate. The males offer up hearts they have collected from humanoids to attract females. Those that manage to secure a mate rarely survive long though, as their mating ritual is short and violent.

Farmers and ranchers, especially those living near swamps known to contain giant slugs, keep close tabs on these journeys. Many almanacs go into great detail on slug migration and mating seasons. Since each giant slug needs its own wide hunting ground, the creatures typically come into proximity to mate only once a year. Either or both slugs can become impregnated, and any that do typically lay a clutch of around 100 eggs. They usually lay these eggs in a shallow bog or a cool, humid cave.

Many amateur spelunkers have met untimely ends in the clutches of this monstrous fungus's tentacles, since violet fungi are practically synonymous with caverns on Golarion. Anyone who has ever braved the world's caves for an extended period of time know the dangers of the deadly violet fungus. Darklands dwellers such as drow and duergars often bear the long, whip-like scars of at least one brush with this vicious plant's cruel, poison-infused tentacles. Canny subterranean trappers and scouts sometimes make use of cultivated violent fungi to catch game in the enormous caverns below the surface world. Some Darklands peoples also cultivate violet fungi as a means to defend their territory. Xulgaths in particular place violet fungi around the perimeters of their settlements as a first line of defense."}

Sylphs are notorious for their practice of \"listening to the wind,\" which most others dismiss as a fancy name for eavesdropping. Yet this custom means much more to sylphs, who spend hours listening to the stories brought to them on the proverbial breeze. While some less scrupulous sylphs may use the information they learn to blackmail or abuse others, most of them see listening to the wind as their way of staying connected to the world around them while still keeping it comfortably at arm's length. Certainly the typical sylph sneak doesn't seek to use what they learn for ill, but instead tries to warn others of dangers yet unrealized or to prepare themself for a dangerous task."}

While the hounds possess great cunning and cruel intellect, they rarely interact with other creatures-other than to hunt and destroy those who have attracted their unblinking attention. Once a hound catches scent of a mortal to hunt, it calls others of its ilk. The pack then pursues its victim through all space and time until it catches, slays and devours them.

What appears to be a bifurcated lower jaw is actually two spiky parapodia that the worm uses to shovel food into its lamprey-like mouth. An adult frost worm measures 35 feet long and weighs 8,000 pounds. A frost worm is an apex predator that uses camouflage, burrowing, and deceit to ambush its prey. When it attacks, a frost worm produces a distinctive, high-pitched trill. Though some survivors of frost worm attacks have compared it to a wailing lament, the trill has a captivating effect on nearby creatures, causing them to stop and listen even as the monstrous creature approaches. The cold shed by a frost worm is as dangerous as its trill or its jaws, and while it is not fond of warmer climates, neither is it particularly hampered in such regions. A frost worm that somehow finds itself in temperate or even tropical environs causes the immediate area to chill and ice over with frost over time, creating seemingly impossible pockets of frozen terrain."}

When food is scarce, an akata secretes a resin from its pores that forms into a sturdy cocoon of pale green crystal-the skymetal noqual. An akata can hibernate in this cocoon without needing to eat or drink for centuries, though it retains a rudimentary sense of its surroundings and can break out in only a few minutes' time. These cocoons allow the creatures to travel through the void of space, seeking new worlds where they can infect suitable humanoid hosts with their larval young. Once a victim succumbs to this infection, the offspring fight among themselves until one proves the strongest.

Magma dragons build lairs within volcanically active mountains or deep underground amid vast lakes of bubbling magma. As with all true dragons, magma dragons keep hoards of treasure, but the nature of their searing lairs limits the type of valuables they collect to metals, gems, and items capable of resisting the heat of a volcano's core."}

Their other habits also vary widely from individual to individual, right down to diet: some wereboars might feast on human flesh, while others are mostly vegetarian."}

Cloud dragons spend long hours surveying the lands they fly over from great heights, but they are creatures of whim, making it hard to predict what will pique their curiosity and bring them winging down to converse or investigate something on the ground. Cloud dragons seldom perform acts of outright malice, but they are not often charitable either. A cloud dragon is as likely to simply pluck something they desire off the ground and fly away with it as they are to bargain fairly. A cloud dragon's ever-changing interests never seem to stray toward the complicated schemes and long-term plans of other dragons. These rovers are creatures of the moment, and although they are as mentally gifted as other true dragons, their interests remain in the here and now. Yet the cloud dragon's penchant fo"}

As they are both opinionated and willing to impose their sense of order on others, many brine dragons eventually seek to rule over a meticulously crafted community. These communities are orderly and well-planned, with rigid standards of courtesy and unchanging laws set down by the dragon themself. A settlement seeded by a brine dragon can be made of members of almost any ancestry, but the most common inhabitants are humans, merfolk, tengus, or sahuagin. Depending on the dragon's personality, their community members might view their brine dragon ruler as anything from a benevolent force of order to a fearful tyrant. Regardless, the typical brine dragon has little patience for kindness or philanthropy, and the strength and health of their settlement as a whole are of greater concern than individuals' well-being. A notable exception to this dispassion rises when an outside force encroaches on their lands. In these cases, the brine dragon is quick to step in and aid in the defense of their community. Althoug"}

The pox-spotted hide along the creature's back bears a draconic tail with dark, spiny plates and two torn, bat-like wings. The legendary Sandpoint Devil appears only on moonless nights when mists gather around the coast. Most encounters end with missing livestock or children, with little left behind other than oddly placed hoofprints that reek of brimstone."}

Its fur is golden, sometimes with a silvery or russet tone depending on the metals it has ingested, and its claws are always the shiny black of seasoned iron. Aurumvorax adults claim hunting territories spanning a mile or more, driving out other predators and leading solitary lives except when they mate. They are irascible creatures, impossible to train as adults, but daring trainers can rear aurumvorax pups as deadly guard beasts, which they sell for hundreds of gold pieces to discriminating buyers. Aurumvorax pups are usually single births, and their mothers are fiercely protective, making their acquisition a dangerous proposition. Even when trained, the creatures are prone to dangerous bursts of rage."}
