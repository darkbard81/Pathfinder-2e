However, the primary use of their skin flaps isn't for movement, but digestion. When it rains, flynketts roll up their loose skin, creating a crude sort of kettle in which to catch precipitation. The remarkable creatures' acid combines with the falling water to break down wood, soil, or even rocks into a nutritional stew. Therefore, the flynkett can flourish when introduced to any environment with frequent rain, something solid to stand on, and a lack of natural predators.

Agrarian gnome communities have a close relationship with hardhead moles. Gnome children especially hold a great fondness for the creatures, and indeed, gave them their name. When they wander into the fields to play with these moles—typically by hitting them with small sticks, mallets, or any semi-blunt object—the moles are more than happy to oblige, darting from burrow to burrow with every sparkling blow in friendly games of hide-and-seek or tag. Perhaps the most famous hardhead mole is the gnome goddess Nivi Rhombodazzle's planar servitor Rummbrrlar, a hardhead mole imbued by Nivi with the powers of an earth elemental.

A small team of apprentice mages established the original virtuosic lyrebirds as part of their graduation thesis, in an attempt to create a familiar that could better aid in spellcasting. The vocal mimicry of these birds did indeed allow them to harmonize with their bonded spellcaster; however, initial progress was slow, and the impatient students chose to hastily elevate the birds' abilities before their thesis deadline using experimental magic. Unfortunately, the specimens' newfound vocal mimicry was so supreme that they could mimic spell incantations as easily as any other sound they heard. The virtuosic lyrebirds soon vaporized, teleported out of, or befuddled their keepers into opening their cages, escaping into the wild and flourishing. Virtuosic lyrebirds use their spellcasting abilities mostly to play pranks and alleviate boredom. They tend to travel in pairs, but when these pairs congregate into larger flocks, their mischief and fun can quickly turn dangerous."}

They're born with retractable rear legs and an incredibly strong, flexible spine. Their sharp foreclaws feature sharp hooks that can rend flesh or stabilize it when it enters its wheel-shaped form. As they develop, hooplamanders learn how to leap and roll, hooking their tails beneath their mouths and stabilizing them with their foreclaws to form a crude wheel that they use their tail muscles to propel forward. Their backs are ridged with a tread-like pattern that gives significant traction and maneuvering power.

Both elves and lashuntas have brought shotalashus to Golarion, though elves are somewhat more likely to sell or give them away. Mounted combatants covet these alien creatures, though taming one is not as simple as buying a horse or camel. A shotalashu must form a telepathic bond with their rider before any riding is permitted, and once the creature forms such a bond, they will not permit any other rider. While telepaths have the easiest time forming this bond, others have found ways to prove their worth. Any shotalashus encountered in the wilds of Golarion most likely escaped from captivity—a notable wild pack exists on the Isle of Kortos, descended from such runaways. Would-be riders are most likely to find available shotalashus in Absalom, Kyonin, and southern Garund. Shotalashus are extravagantly expensive to raise on Golarion, resulting in corresponding prices when they appear on t"}

Despite its size, the sheer muscle mass present in this creature makes flight seem effortless, if preposterous. It makes its home among the canopies of the most ancient forests and atop the peaks of the greatest mountains, hunting its prey from above with silent and deadly accuracy. The ascendant griffon prefers to hunt other large creatures within its territory, such as bears, but they will not hesitate to attack smaller prey they perceive as a threat to their territory. Whether an ascendant griffon is a new evolutionary development or a throwback to a more primeval version of the creature is difficult to determine. Further research into these exceptional creatures may provide insight into their origins and perhaps the origins of all griffons."}

Humanoids keep dogs, kobolds care for reptiles, and so on. More terrifying, as it is on a grander scale, linnorms with a strong attachment to the First World sometimes keep mutated hydras as pets and guards. Known to Ulfens as tyrafdirs, these beasts have the unique ability to create illusory doubles from the ruined stumps of their necks. These serpentine guardians serve as strong protectors in the Land of the Linnorm Kings, where their fey-warped physiology deters many a would-be monarch from claiming their master's head. The domestication of tyrafdirs by especially powerful spellcasters to serve as guardians has been known to take place, often combined with magical traps that attack the intruder's mind."}

These birds feast on blood and carrion and have quickly learned that battlefields provide both in abundance. In spite of this grisly diet, they're best known for another strange adaptation: they build their nests from pieces of armor, weapons, and magic items scavenged on the battlefields. This leaves young scroungefeathers remarkably well protected, allowing both parents to leave the nest to search for food. Alarmingly, scroungefeathers have learned how to use the items they scavenge for their nests to fend off attackers, flinging arrowheads, thrashing about with knives, and even activating the occasional wand. A scroungefeather nest makes a tempting target for adventurers and thieves, as the treasures tucked within can be quite valuable, but the birds defend their nests fiercely, particularly when there are eggs or chicks inside. While the feathers of scroungefeathers don't have any magical properties, they're popular among thieves. Insignia for thieves' guilds often include the image of a black feather with two crimson stripes, and such organizations often send new recruits to r"}
