During the Great Abandonment, when the gods left the First World, many yakshas rejected this exodus, instead staying to perform their duties as caretakers. Despite the realm's sudden dearth of divine power, the remaining yakshas swore primordial vows, allowing them to channel power from the nearby Creation's Forge into primal magic and transform swathes of the metamorphic First World into stable regions to provide refuge for destitute fey.</em></p>\n<p><em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.journals.JournalEntry.45SK8rdbbxvEHfMn.JournalEntryPage.f6IU2EGcJUzVZ4nD]{Yaksha}</em></p>"},"flaws":{"0":{"value":["int"]}},"hp":8,"items":{},"languages":{"custom":"","value":["common","fey","yaksha"]},"publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Lost Omens Tian Xia Character Guide"},"reach":5,"rules":[],"size":"med","speed":25,"traits":{"rarity":"rare","value":["spirit","yaksha"]},"vision":"low-light-vision","slug":"yaksha","_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"ancestry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.ancestries.Item.k3zyr6du4gV0Ftuh"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"kYsBAJ103T44agJF","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/alternatives/ancestries/automaton.svg","name":"Automaton","system":{"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"custom":"","value":["chthonian","diabolic","dwarven","elven","empyrean","jistkan","petran","pyric","sussuran","thalassic"]},"boosts":{"0":{"value":["str"]},"1":{"value":[]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"description":{"value":"<p><em>These intelligent constructs house actual souls and represent what remains of a dying empire's last attempt at greatness.
