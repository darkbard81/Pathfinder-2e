Because a wyvern lacks the strength to haul their prey all the way to their nest intact, they're far more likely to lift and drop their victim over a gully or canyon and let gravity do its work before they descend to pick apart the carcass.

Many once thought the con rit to be a dragon of some kind. This was due not only to its massive size but also to its ability to launch its venom in a concentrated blast. It would use this technique to shoot birds out of the sky or knock sailors off ships. Their movement through the water is also not entirely dissimilar to that of dragons.

Their propensity for forming raiding parties—small social groups fittingly called \"rampages\"—makes them all the more dangerous; a single rampage of river drakes can quickly lay waste to a waterside village, and roving rampages of desert drakes are a plague to caravan traders.

Unlike a grizzly bear, however, a cave bear is short tempered and will make sure its foe is dead before moving on, usually feasting on its prey's soft flesh once it has been incapacitated. Cave bears are often regarded as powerful guardian spirits by remotedwelling people, though they are also utilized as beasts of war by orcs or even giants. Stone giants in particular have an affinity for keeping trained cave bears as pets or guardians for their homes. Bears are ferocious predators typically found in cold or temperate woodlands and hills. Many species of bear exist in addition to the two presented below, such as the smaller black bear or the arctic-dwelling polar bear."}

The magical energies that flow through a fortune dragon constantly flow through the dragon's items as well, and in many cases, the items melt from the heat produced in this process.

Most niliths lack the patience to spend too much time fully tearing down an individual, and when a nilith tires of its current plaything and becomes bored with its particular thoughts and fears, it murders the quarry before feeding on its flesh and moving onto the next victim. Niliths are actually extensions of much deadlier creatures that dwell in a distant dimension beyond dreams—in a way, niliths are little more than remote feeding machines for the unknown alien entities to which"}

The dragon's nature of drawing upon magic causes coins, gems, and, most notably, magical items to cling to their body like iron drawn to magnets. A dragon constantly pulls magical energies from the items attached to their body and makes use of these energies to cast spells. The magical energies that flow through a fortune dragon constantly flow through the dragon's items as well, and in many cases, the items melt from the heat produced in this process.

As with guard dogs, these large hounds can be wild or feral in nature, and in such cases might rival wolf packs in the danger they pose to inhabitants of rural areas. Dogs are trusted and loyal companions that serve as guardians, tracking animals, and pets. Their ability to detect prey or predators via scent and their predilection to accompany humanoids makes them ideal pets for most adventurers. There are hundreds of breeds of dogs in the world—from tiny lapdogs who shower their masters in affection to brawny hounds that stand nearly 4 feet high at the shoulder—and they can be found in nearly any place where people reside. Larger breeds might even be used as mounts for smaller adventurers, and some cultures use dogs as beasts of burden capable of pulling sleds loaded with supplies across the icy tundra. Regardless, many adventurers find value in having a dog."}

The magical energies that flow through a fortune dragon constantly flow through the dragon's items as well, and in many cases, the items melt from the heat produced in this process.

Female krooths, on the other hand, are more likely to shy away from potential predators but swiftly turn violent when their brood is threatened. Because their offspring are so vulnerable, female krooths gather in packs to raise their young, sending smaller groups to hunt for food while the rest of the pack watches the brood. Krooths mate only once every 4 or 5 years, and the mating process is a curiously gruesome spectacle. An entire pack of females will hunt as a group for a lone male krooth, claiming their prize in a frenzy that can last for an entire day and night.

The variations seem to conform to the griffon's environment—for instance, especially rare griffons of northern Avistan have the hindquarters of a Grungir lynx and the upper body of a snowy owl. Wild griffons rely on their powerful wings to hold them aloft and their keen eyesight to spy out prey. The speed with which they plunge toward the ground and snatch up victims is astonishing. They often tear apart a kill's flesh with razor-sharp beaks but not before alighting to secluded location where they can enjoy their meal without interruption. Griffons hunting to feed their chicks are more cautious, tearing apart prey rather than risking bringing a living creature back to their nests.

Regardless, a pegasus never accepts a bit or saddle, for reasons both practical (a standard horse saddle interferes with its wings) and purely out of its pride as a free and untamed creature.

Even though deities rarely have the time to monitor their effigies, lesser divine servants are sometimes tasked with watching over an effigy. When the effigy is damaged, these guardians can sense it. The most precious effigies are layered with rituals that summon their guardians directly. Experienced tomb robbers learn to spot such markings from afar, so as to be forewarned of any divine interference in the area. Although often assigned to protect valuable religious relics and other treasure, clay effigies' size and heavy movements make them ill-suited to stand guard among fragile items. Entire treasuries have been totally ruined by clumsy battles, so craft"}

Hobgoblins are singularly devoted to war, and their entire culture is built upon fostering and maintaining conflict while simultaneously proving their superiority in battle. Hobgoblins are highly organized, and they work efficiently and effectively in groups, whether that group is a small raiding party, a roving war band, or a fully regimented army. Hobgoblin rulers require little provocation before declaring war, and more often than not, such wars are waged to gain slaves or territory. Physically, hobgoblins stand about as tall as humans and have gray, ashen skin. Hobgoblin society is organized along military lines, and every hobgoblin is effectively a member of the army. Each hobgoblin in a community has a rank in the military hierarchy, and individuals are naturally ambitious and obsessed with advancement."}

Sometimes associated with good-aligned deities, other times associated with nature and the fey, unicorns are always known for their righteousness and nobility. They are wary, at best, of most humanoid creatures, due in large part to poachers' tendency to hunt them for their horns, but unicorns are often rumored to have a weakness for those who are pure of both heart and spirit.

Giant stag beetles can be a serious menace in marshes, cavern complexes, and heavy forests. More than one logging camp has attracted a cluster of giant stag beetles and had to be completely abandoned, yielding all its lumber to the hunger of the giant insects. Not all beetles are harmless creatures that can be easily crushed underfoot. Oversized and ravenous giant beetles can be found throughout the temperate and tropical regions of the world. They are often benign creatures, though when threatened or roused, giant beetles are quite dangerous. Their powerful mandibles and tough exoskeletons make for a challenging combatant."}

The burrow serves as both a safe haven and a location from which the lizard can ambush larger prey such as deer, boars, or even humanoids.

They accept the term \"catfolk\" as a name for their people with grace and a hint of amusement. Ever eager to explore and learn, catfolk have spread to other parts of the world from their native nations in the southern tropics, yet never in large groups. A lone amurrun can be found anywhere in the world, but it's rare to find a settlement beyond their traditional national borders. This is due to their innate wanderlust and insatiable wonder. As many an amurrun might say, \"I've lived with my people my whole life, but you? You're new and different! There's so much to learn from you!\" Longstanding amurrun legends"}

A daring few athamarus use the embedded harpoon as a handle to ride prey for a short time. Once the creature is tired, remaining hunters finish it with longspears. Athamarus developed this hunting tradition to forge skilled warriors and deter potential attackers, partially in response to centuries of oppression and mistreatment from other aquatic cultures. Athamarus rarely hunt land-dwellers, instead offering to trade their services as guides in exchange for metal and ceramic items they can't build underwater—and for tubers, which they consider earthy delicacies.

Against despoilers of nature who fail to heed their warnings, centaurs do not hesitate to use their finely honed hunting skills to inflict deadly wounds.

This combination makes it even more popular as a trained pet or guard, but even then one should take care to not annoy the dinosaur—an angry stegosaurus can lash out with little warning. Remnants from the world's primeval era, these enormous reptilian animals still exist in large numbers in remote wildernesses or underground in magical Darklands caverns. Lizardfolk, orcs, giants, and other humanoids who live near dinosaurs use the animals as mounts, guards, or hunting beasts. Occasionally, rich nobles will collect dinosaurs to display them in menageries, which almost inevitably leads to cast-offs being nursed back to health by druids and other champions of nature.

The dragon's nature of drawing upon magic causes coins, gems, and, most notably, magical items to cling to their body like iron drawn to magnets. A dragon constantly pulls magical energies from the items attached to their body and makes use of these energies to cast spells. The magical energies that flow through a fortune dragon constantly flow through the dragon's items as well, and in many cases, the items melt from the heat produced in this process.

As these crystals grind against each other and hum with sickening blue energy, crystal flakes and powdery residue collect beneath the machinery. Dero magisters gather these products, creating to"}

Magical mishaps, divine curses, and untested technology are all capable of wreaking drastic transformations on the body, and are all rampant on the world of Golarion and beyond.

The lamia's animalistic nature and the effect of their cursed touch have led some scholars to theorize that the original lamias must have, millennia ago, turned away from their own reason and intellect and embraced the life of simple beasts. Whether this change was rewarded as a monstrous gift from Lamashtu or inflicted as a curse for abandoning their responsibilities by Pharasma, remains a subject of debate to this day. Whatever the source of this ancient transformation, lamias have grown to enjoy the strengths it has granted them.
