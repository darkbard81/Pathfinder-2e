Aldus spoke of meeting a cult following a desiccated angel named Tabris. Tabris revealed the secret history of the multiverse and tasked Aldus with acting as a messenger of mystic secrets. Upon his return, Aldus gathered a coterie of his fellow Ustalavic nobles eager to plumb these secrets.

Scouring Aldus's texts-both those brought from Osirion and his many annotations and reinterpretations penned thereafter-has been the order's primary activity for centuries, even before the increasingly erratic Aldus disappeared in 4028 AR.

Instead, mortal beings must shape their own fate, aware of their own limitations, trusting in their reliance upon one another and their shared values rather than divine intervention and guidance. This philosophy is summed up in the primary tenet of the Laws of Mortality: Let no mortal be beholden to a god.</p>\n<p><strong>Areas of Concern</strong> mortal affairs, peace, self-rule</p>\n<p><strong>Edicts</strong> challenge religious power and the spread of religion, expose and eradicate hidden worship, provide a peaceful and autonomous society in which the people are cared for through social infrastructure</p>\n<p><strong>Anathema</strong> worship or swear an oath by a deity or religion, solicit or receive divine or religious aid, take a side in conflicts between religions</p>"},"domains":{"alternate":[],"primary":[]},"font":[],"publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Lost Omens Divine Mysteries"},"rules":[],"sanctification":null,"skill":["medicine"],"spells":{},"traits":{},"weapons":[],"slug":"laws-of-mortality","_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"deity","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.deities.Item.4I1aVKED08cwcC4H"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"4Rjj2SA7xSxT1ftC","folder":"82pLYmBc68wC4tCD","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/deity.svg","name":"Aegirran","system":{"attribute":["con","wis"],"category":"deity","description":{"value":"<p>Predominantly worshipped by tide giants, Aegirran is venerated as the god of dreams, sailing, and ocean voyages.

For the Crimson Reclaimers, this means never forgetting the pain and trauma caused by the Whispering Tyrant in Lastwall, and channeling that grief into fuel for righteous revenge. Beyond these two major divine influences, three other deities represent values the followers of the pantheon hold dear. Gorum (Our Lord in Iron) preaches strength and victory in battle. Iomedae (The Inheritor) led the charge on many successful attacks against Tar-Baphon, so it's only natural that her legendary deeds, and sense of honor, justice, and valor speak to followers of Sorrow's Sword. Many consider Arazni (The Unyielding) to be a strong part of this pantheon, due to her edict to survive at all costs and her abhorrence for the creation of unwilling undead.

Before the Carved Lady of Mimicry arrived on the Plane of Wood, it was a diverse and cultivated forest that stretched as far as the eye could see, yet it was eerily still. Animated creatures were rare, and beyond the wind through the boughs, little moved. Then Shumunue came to establish the Court of Transcendence. In her grotto, she taught the flowers and leaves to mimic praying mantises, bees, and moths. Then came herds of wooden deer, cranes, bats, and more, all delicately carved and polished. Within their minds, Shumunue imparted to these creatures the blueprints for their species and the instinct to carve their own descendants. Thus the Plane of Wood began to fill with life that resembled creatures from beyond its borders.</p>\n<p>Some legends claim Shumunue is a construct who gained sentience for being universally perfect, but the Lady of Mimicry disputes this, stating that she's the product of a union between a kodama and a kizidhar wizard who traveled to her plane. She rules over no land or organization, for she sees no need to exert her personal opinions on anybody else. She instead dedicates herself to the act of creation. Rather than having subjects, the Carved Lady keeps a close group of confidants, who put in requests for her immense powers on behalf of others in need.</p>\n<p>Shumunue maintains a sophisticated esca, or lure, of golden-hued wood. She regularly shaves this lure into the shape of a female humanoid with a head of ginkgo leaves. Some mistake this esca for Shumunue's physical form, but in actuality, the Carved Lady closely resembles an enormous forest dragon with scales like the bark of ancient trees. Her left flank bears a large blighted patch where Ayrzul's poison left its mark.

As Embaral sent gentle waves onto the shores adjoining his waters to better understand them, the goddess Vudravati was drawn to his persistence and patience, and the two fell in love.</p>\n<p>But Vudravati also loved Embaral's twin, Obari. While the goddess was happy to take both as lovers, the jealous brothers soon went to war with each other for her affections. Obari sent typhoons to stir chaos in Embaral's waters, while Embaral stilled the winds raised by his brother and flooded the distant lands that Obari loved. The other ocean gods attempted to intervene to disastrous effect, with many losing their lives and immortality in the ensuing battles. As the war spilled across borders and waves, other gods of sea and storm abandoned their traditional demesnes to help shield mortals from the effects of the brothers' wrath. They created bays and seas, coordinating with gods of earth and stone to form peninsulas and islands, anything that the immortal powers could arrange to curtail the brother's influence and stay the fallout of their wrath. A few gods and immortal beings of the great waters fled Golarion altogether, seeking worlds and dominions that were not active battlegrounds for potent and violent immortal forces. But even when Embaral and Obari fought alone in isolated segments of Golarion's oceans, their war for dominance raged unabated, neither willing to be the first to retreat nor willing to sacrifice their emotional claims. Only Vudravati was able to stop the brothers' war, physically separating Embaral and Obari by lying between them in an endless sleep.

Yet in 3823 ar, the Knights of Ozem fatefully chose to bind her to their will as they rallied against the Whispering Tyrant. Despite her heroism in leading the charge, the Whispering Tyrant prevailed, and he took particular delight in capturing, humiliating, torturing, and finally killing her. Although the Knights of Ozem recovered her body, they—and Aroden—failed her again when the necromancer Geb had her body stolen and then reanimated against her will, turning her into a lich. In thrall to Geb for over a thousand years, she ruled his nation, all the while suffering torments that changed her profoundly. She endured all of them.</p>\n<p>Not long ago, Arazni decided to risk allying with mortals once again and, with their help, succeeded in tricking the Whispering Tyrant into destroying the magic that bound her to lichdom and to Geb. During her time on Geb's throne, she had been worshipped as a god, though few of the Gebbite masses who paid her obeisance were sincere.

Razmir founded his first temple in the Melcatian city of Xer, where he began elevating masked priests to serve him and teaching the doctrine of the 31 Steps. Razmir then annihilated the Duke of Melcat and all his followers for heresy with a potent act of magic, making evidence of his godhood plain for all to see. Razmir's faith and earthly dominion spread quickly through the River Kingdoms after this, though his reign has been plagued by fools who continue the heresies of Duke Melcat.

You won't find a city of any size in the region that doesn't boast a sizable temple to honor his tenets of expanding civilization, promoting prosperity, and following the rule of law. This pantheon expands his focus by enjoining the kinder and more uplifting elements of urban life, shifting away from Abadar's well-known pursuit of wealth to a pursuit of peace and prosperity for everyone in the city. Worshippers of this pantheon invoke Alseta the Welcomer, who watches over city gates to keep invaders out and defenders safe, as well as Tanagaar the Aurulent Eye, who keeps a careful eye over those who protect the innocent at night. Adherents to this pantheon also look to Alseta for guidance in making their cities open and welcoming to all peaceful dwellers therein and for wisdom through the many transitions of urban life; they strive to follow her edict of treating all other beings with courtesy and respect. From Korada, they draw their inspiration in the pursuit of a peaceful mindset and public policy that enjoins harmony, using the law to support redemption. In another departure from what you'll see as a common Abadaran practice, the worshippers of this pantheon don't build opulent, flashy temples. Their shrines often skew toward the simple, as the Urban Prosperity tends to distribute any money it raises to those causes that promote peace and bring prosperity to all.

In spite of his antics, Ragdya is much beloved, as he brings with him an infectious aura of mirth and excitement for all things in life.</p>\n<p>Yet, for all the joy, there's also sorrow, for Ragdya sits alone watching over his progeny, the vanaras, and his faithful. He offers rebirth so his followers might come to better know themselves with continued experience, but in so doing, he can't have the happiness of holding his children close. Still, he wishes them to know the joy of love, to experience how the power of laughter can bond them with others regardless of station, and to hold their sorrows at bay for just a moment more. He wants them to know that there's no shame in learning a lesson borne from failure, but rather great pride in true humility and in being able to work past the ego to instead find humor in all the silly stages of life.</p>\n<p>A common saying is that \"a Ragdyan tries anything at least once, and gladly tells you the story of how it went wrong at least twice.\" For his many rural followers, being a Ragdyan means being open to expanding their horizons when the chance arrives, even if they're unable to go out and adventure themselves. The church of the mountain sage can be found in a plethora of places, from grandstanding, intricate temples to small shrines in remote villages, to the corners of restaurants in big cities and to prominently placed altars in taverns, where people from all over can come together and exchange tales of their lives. No matter the location, there will always be a depiction of Bahmenu with the Sage sitting atop it, hoping for the faithful to bless the shrines with the sound of laughter.

Cayden Cailean reminds them every person deserves to live a life free of oppressive restrains, as well as a little leisure occasionally to lighten their loads.
