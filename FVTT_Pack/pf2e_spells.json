While some versions of this ritual offer all the forms, others include only a single form or only a few of them. Whichever form you use, the effect can't be counteracted, though it can be ended by {Freedom}. Some forms of imprisonment can be ended by other means. Because the ritual requires the target to remain within 10 feet at all times, it typically requires you to subdue the target first.\n\nChains You bind the creature with chains, rendering it unable to use any actions other than to speak. Other creatures that attempt to approach, harm the chains, or free the trapped creature in any way must succeed at a Will save or be unable to do so forever. The chains have Hardness equal to 5 × the imprisonment ritual's spell rank and double that many Hit Points. Destroying the chains frees the target.\n\nPrison You render the creature completely unable to leave a particular confined area or structure of your choice, such as a jail cell or sealed cave. The magic also prevents the creature from damaging its prison, either directly or indirectly, to break free. If the creature's prison is entirely destroyed by some external force, the creature is freed, though for some larger or natural prisons, this might be unfeasible.\n\nSlumber You put the creature into an eternal sleep. This is a sleep effect. The creature ceases aging and doesn't require food or drink. A single sincere physical display of affection from a creature who genuinely loves the target—whether romantically, filially, or otherwise—frees it from the slumber.\n\nTemporal Stasis You send the creature into a state of suspended animation outside the flow of time. The creature doesn't grow older and can't be affected by any effect from within the normal timestream. While casting this ritual, you can optionally name any amount of time for the stasis; after this duration elapses, the stasis ends. Unlike other forms of imprisonment, temporal stasis can be counteracted by a {Dispel Magic} or {Haste} spell.\n\nObject (9th or 10th rank) You either shrink the creature to an inch in height or transform it into an insubstantial form whose body trails away into wisps below its head. Either way, you trap it inside a bottle, gem, jar, lamp, or similar container. The creature ceases aging and doesn't require food or drink. The creature is still aware of its surroundings and can move within the container and speak, but it can't use any other actions.

This performance must be presented to an audience of at least a hundred people, a majority of whom must both be connected, at least peripherally, to the events in question (the people of the tyrant's city, or the residents of the village where the murder occurred) and who must understand what the metaphor or allegory actually refers to.

These astral forms can be used to explore the Astral Plane indefinitely, while the targets' bodies remain safely in stasis on the plane where the ritual was cast (where they remain {Unconscious} and can't be awoken normally). The casters must be in physical contact with one another in a circle for the duration of the casting, and all targets must be selected from these casters.\n\nA target's astral form is a duplicate of the target and everything they're carrying; anything that happens to a duplicate item happens to the original as well. For instance, if you use, spend, destroy, lose, or give away an item's duplicate, the original vanishes from your possession. For the duration of the ritual, any of the targets can spend a single action to Dismiss their astral form and immediately return to their physical body. As the primary caster, when you Dismiss your astral form, you can also Dismiss all the other targets' astral forms as part of the same action, returning all targets to their physical forms simultaneously.

When the ritual ends, the targets' astral forms vanish.\n\nA target's astral form and corresponding physical form are linked by an incorporeal silver cord, which is visible only in the Astral Plane. This nearly unbreakable cord serves as conduit and safety line; if severed, the target's astral and physical forms are both immediately slain. If the ritual is interrupted by an external force, such as dispel magic being cast on a target's physical or astral form, the target is immediately and harmlessly returned to their physical body. If a target's astral form is slain, the silver cord immediately rips them back to their physical body; the strain requires them to attempt a Fortitude save with the same DC as the ritual's primary check. On a failure, the creature dies; on a success, it becomes {Clumsy 2}, {Drained 2}, {Doomed 2}, and enfeebled 2 for 1 week; these conditions can't be removed or reduced by any means until the week has passed. A target's physical body remains in suspended animation for the duration of the ritual, but if it's destroyed, the creature dies and its astral form also vanishes.

For short journeys, this lack of precision is irrelevant, but for long distances this could be up to 1 mile.\n\nHeightened (7th) You and the other targets can travel to any location within 1,000 miles.\n\nHeightened (8th) You and the other targets can travel to any location on the same planet.

Large fortifications, such as city walls, and inhospitable natural features, such as wide rivers, will stop the trees, but the forest can shape itself around small buildings and streams.

Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage. However, illusory damage does not deactivate regeneration or trigger other effects that require a certain damage type.

When the fire is hot enough, you roast bat wings, horse hooves, and lizards over it until they're tender enough to eat; for the hooves, this could take hours.

You then use those samples to grow a duplicate of the target's physical form that will house the target's soul upon death. This duplicate is physically identical to the original creature.\n\nIn order to perform the ritual, you need an expanded alchemist's lab or a superior set of equipment. Once the ritual is successfully completed, the duplicate grows within the laboratory equipment for [[/r 2d4]] months. Though direct involvement isn't required during this period of growth, you must prevent any interference or interruption, or the ritual fails. When the duplicate is complete, the original creature's soul enters it as soon as their original body dies, or immediately if the creature died during the intervening months, as long as the soul is free and willing.

Each sensor looks where that target looks, and all the targets can link their vision briefly to help notice things one target sees but the others might not. Each target can use an action, which has the concentrate trait, to share what it sees with any number of other targets until the start of its next turn. Only one creature can share its vision at a time, so if another target takes this action, the effect ends for any target that was previously sharing its vision.\n\nThis improves how well the recipients can perceive anything the sharing creature is looking at. For instance, if a creature is undetected to a recipient but observed by the sharing creature, the creature becomes observed by the recipient as well. Typically, the creature is seen as a glowing outline superimposed on its position. This might allow the recipient to target a creature it couldn't otherwise; however, cover and line of effect still might prevent or impede targeting and attacks. This can only improve the recipient's vision, not reduce it; for example, if an enemy was undetected by the sharing creature and observed by a recipient, the recipient would still clearly observe the enemy.\n\nOnce the vision sharing stops, the benefit ends. Whether a creature is hidden or undetected is still based on the last information a target had before the vision sharing ended. For example, that means if a creature is behind a wall but hasn't moved, it's still hidden rather than undetected by a recipient that witnessed its current position."}

You can electrically charge yourself by taking a single action, which has the manipulate trait.

Initially created by the elven wizard Aelthian in hopes of banishing Treerazer himself, this revision to that faulty ritual focuses instead upon the region he blighted rather than the nascent demon lord himself. Thus avoiding the catastrophic repercussions Aelthian experienced when he attempted to direct this magic against a foe too powerful to directly harm.\n\nThis version draws upon the ancient legacy of the forest itself by calling upon the remnants of primal spirits that remain locked away in Tanglebriar, bolstering them with elven magic. Successfully performing the ritual in an area in which Treerazer is currently located is more difficult, but the ritual's effects can weaken and distract him. If Treerazer is slain or banished, the effects of this ritual are longer lasting and less expensive—see \"Cleansing Tanglebriar\" on page 67 of this volume for more details.\n\nPurify Tanglebriar's primary caster must succeed at a DC 41 check, while the secondary casters must succeed at a DC 36 check. If Treerazer is present in the ritual's targeted area, these checks increase to DC 43 for the primary caster and DC 38 for the secondary casters, but if the primary caster wears the Viridian Crown, all checks for the primary and secondary casters are reduced by 5.\n\nCritical Success The region within the area grows less blighted for 1 month (during which time additional purify Tanglebriar attempts in this area have no additional effect). Greater difficult terrain becomes difficult terrain; difficult terrain becomes regular terrain, and hazardous terrain becomes non-hazardous. All DCs to {Sense Direction}, {Subsist}, and to resist environmental afflictions in the area are reduced by 4.

Creatures allied with Treerazer take no penalty to Initiative checks. If Treerazer is in the area when the ritual is performed, the party gains 1 Torment Point and 1 Triumph Point.\n\nFailure The region is unaffected.\n\nCritical Failure The region is unaffected, and the magic itself becomes corrupted and backfires on the casters. Each caster takes @Damage[20d6[void]] damage (@Check[fortitude|dc:38|basic] save) as the purification energies sap away life itself.

It can have the appearance of any mundane environment or structure, such as a glorious cathedral, a forest clearing, a comfortably furnished cavern, or anything else imaginable. All demiplanes have finite, unbreachable boundaries, which might resemble stone, wood, or something more unnatural, such as a wall of mist or unceasing void.\n\nDemiplanes have environmental conditions appropriate for the Universe, though the primary caster can dictate a general climate or light level as well as whether the demiplane experiences seasons or a day-night cycle. The demiplane has no native plants or animals, but they can be introduced, and plants will grow in a demiplane's light.\n\nWhen you first cast create demiplane, the casters are teleported to the demiplane. The demiplane has no direct access to other worlds, so {Interplanar Teleport} or similar abilities are necessary to access it.

Most resemble ornate keys, but some take the form of maps, compasses, or dowsing rods.\n\nIf you have the original planar key to an existing demiplane and are also on that demiplane, you can cast this ritual again. Each time, you can either expand the demiplane's size or add one special trait or feature described below.\n\nBounteous The demiplane has a functional ecosystem with plants and animals appropriate to the environment.
