Like other cantrips, you can cast psi cantrips as often as you like, and they are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Your psi cantrips are in addition to the cantrips you choose from the occult list as part of your psychic spellcasting. Generally, only feats can give you more psi cantrips. Unlike other cantrips, you can't swap out psi cantrips gained from psychic feats at a later level, unless you swap out the specific feat via retraining. At 1st level, you learn three psi cantrips determined by your choice of conscious mind; one is a unique psi cantrip and two are common cantrips, typically from the occult spellcasting tradition, that you always cast as psi cantrips. You automatically gain more psi cantrips as you progress in your career as a psychic.</p>\n<p>You start with a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. However, unlike other spellcasters, you don't gain focus spells that cost Focus Points to cast. Instead, you use your Focus Points to boost or modify your psi cantrips by applying amps—specialized thoughtforms that alter the expression of your psychic power. Each of your psi cantrips has a special amp heading. Whenever you cast a psi cantrip, you can amp it by spending 1 Focus Point to add the amp effect. You can also gain additional amps through feats, allowing you to substitute a psi cantrip's normal amp effect for another one. You choose which amp to use, if you choose to use any, each time you cast a psi cantrip.

You are not harmed by splash damage from amped <em>ignition</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Amp Heightened (+1)</strong> Instead of using <em>ignition's</em> normal heightened entry, the initial damage increases by 1d10 (1d12 for melee) and the splash damage increases by 1. The persistent fire damage on a critical hit increases by 1d4.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.IxhGEKl63R4QBvkj]{Frostbite}</p>\n<p>You can freeze people from even farther away. The range of your <em>frostbite</em> increases to 120 feet. Your <em>frostbite</em> also gains the following amp.</p>\n<p><strong>Amp</strong> You drain thermal energy at a distance, using what you plunder to replenish yourself. The orb deals 3d4 cold damage. You gain temporary Hit Points equal to half the damage the target takes (after applying resistances and the like). You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Amp Heightened (+1)</strong> The initial damage increases by 2d4 instead of 1d4. The weakness on a critical failure increases by 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Unique Psi Cantrips</strong></p>\n<p>surface: @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.dhpXpzt7TCm8TbHM]{Thermal Stasis}</p>\n<p><strong>Amp</strong> The spell's duration becomes 1 minute.</p>\n<p>deeper: @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.X4T5RlQBrdpmA35n]{Entropic Wheel}</p>\n<p><strong>Amp</strong> You gain two motes instead of one when you Cast the Spell and each time the wheel gains another mote.</p>\n<p>deepest: @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.bZMwSGc9t5K7uxZV]{Redistribute Potential}</p>\n<p><strong>Amp</strong> You can affect the flow of energy on a much grander scale.

The conditions last for 1 minute.</p>\n<p><strong>Amp Heightened (+1)</strong> Increase the damage by 2d6 instead of 1d4.</p>\n<h3><strong>Conservation of Energy</strong></h3>\n<p>Energy can't be created or destroyed, only transferred or changed. Whenever you use your magic to add or remove energy, you must then balance it with the opposing force. The first time in an encounter that you cast a granted spell or standard psi cantrip from your conscious mind, decide whether you're adding energy or removing it. Once you add energy, you must remove energy the next time you cast one of these spells. When you Refocus, you restore yourself to a neutral state, allowing you to once again freely choose whether you add or remove energy on your next spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Adding Energy:</strong> The ability gains the fire trait, any damage it deals is fire damage, and any resistance it grants is to cold damage. It loses any traits matching damage types it no longer deals.</p>\n<p><strong>Removing Energy:</strong> The ability gains the cold trait, any damage it deals is cold damage, and any resistance it grants is to fire damage. It loses any traits matching damage types it no longer deals. <em>Fiery body</em> grants <em>ray of frost</em> instead of <em>produce flame</em> when cast this way.</p>\n<p><strong>Mindshift:</strong> When you use an action that has the mindshift trait, you can choose to add or remove energy to it instead of making it mental. Alter it as normal for adding or removing energy and change any save it requires to a Reflex save.</p>"},"level":{"value":1},"prerequisites":{"value":[]},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Dark

While wearing the armor, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to all saving throws against spells and to AC against spells. Against spells that target the armor directly (like heat metal), you instead gain a +4 circumstance bonus to all saving throws and to AC.</li><li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.hxjdHBJHaB47mBUT]{Camouflage Pigmentation} (Subterfuge Suit Only)</strong> You've modified your armor's exterior to let you blend into your surroundings with ease, as long as you stay still. While wearing your armor, you can Hide even without cover or concealment, as the pigmentation shifts to match your surroundings.</li><li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.svGLZdD4PF7miAKA]{Dense Plating}</strong> You have encased your armor in robust plating. While wearing your armor, you gain resistance to slashing damage equal to half your level.</li><li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.T3742fu7oIM3W6Gz]{Enhanced Resistance}</strong> You've improved upon your initial modification's ability to resist damage. The resistance from your initial armor modification adds your full level, instead of half your level (for instance, phlogistonic regulator's resistance would increase to your level). If you have more than one initial modification that gives resistance, choose which one this applies to.</li><li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.yEfHCwsbsbP6K13Q]{Heavy Construction} (Power Suit Only)</strong> You've expanded your innovation into a heavy bulwark, and your groundbreaking design ensures you don't take any of the drawbacks for such heavy defenses. Your innovation becomes heavy armor, and your proficiency in your innovation armor (but no other heavy armor) advances to be equal to your proficiency in medium armor. If your Strength modifier is at least +3, you remove the Speed penalty entirely instead of reducing it to –5 feet. The armor's adjusted statistics are: <em>AC Bonus</em> +5; <em>Dex Cap</em> +1; <em>Check Penalty</em> –2; <em>Speed Penalty</em> –10 feet; <em>Strength</em> +3; <em>Bulk</em> 3; <em>Group</em> composite; <em>Armor Traits</em> bulwark, entrench.</li><li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.V5qmKLmI3RL68RGb]{Hyper Boosters}</strong> You've improved your speed boosters' power through a breakthrough that significantly increases the energy flow without risking exploding. You gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed, which increases to a +20-foot status bonus when you're in Overdrive. If you're legendary in Crafting, it instead increases to a +30-foot status bonus when you're in Overdrive. You must have the speed boosters modification to select this modification.</li><li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.hwqaS9m2RwGe0kJk]{Layered Mesh}</strong> You've woven an incredibly powerful network of interlocking mesh around your armor, which catches piercing attacks and diffuses them.

Choose one of your construct's unarmed attacks to gain your choice of one initial weapon modification, chosen from the list on page 18 or from other initial weapon modifications to which you have access. The unarmed attack must meet any requirements for the chosen traits (such as being a melee attack for entangling form), and since it's an unarmed attack, it can never meet certain requirements, such as being a simple weapon for complex simplicity.</li><li><strong>Antimagic Construction</strong> Whether you used some clever adaptation of the magic-negating skymetal known as noqual or created magical protections entirely of your own devising, you've made your innovation highly resilient to spells. Your construct innovation gains a +2 circumstance bonus to all saving throws and AC against spells.</li><li><strong>Climbing Limbs</strong> With appendages that can claw or create suction, your construct becomes a capable climber. Your innovation gains a climb Speed equal to half its land Speed.</li><li><strong>Durable Construction</strong> Your innovation is solidly built; it can take significant punishment before being destroyed. Increase its maximum HP by your level.</li><li><strong>Marvelous Gears</strong> Your innovation gains expert proficiency in Intimidation, Stealth, and Survival. For any of these skills in which it was already an expert (because of being an advanced construct companion, for example), it gains master proficiency instead. If you have the revolutionary innovation class feature, these proficiencies improve to master, or legendary if your construct innovation was already an expert. You must have the wonder gears modification to select this modification.</li><li><strong>Turret Configuration</strong> Your innovation can transform from a mobile construct to a stationary turret. Your construct companion can transform as a single action, which has the manipulate trait, turning into a turret in its space (or transforming back from a turret into its normal configuration). While it's a turret, your innovation is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized}, but the damage die from its projectile launcher increases to 1d6 and the range increment increases to 60 feet.

Your innovation gains the free-hand trait.</li><li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.y62b9R6RUBbkZECA]{Manifold Alloy}</strong> You've devised several alloys that contain useful properties of various metals, and you replace a number of parts of your weapon or its ammunition with pieces from these alloys. Your weapon innovation is cold iron and silver. This means you deal more damage to a variety of supernatural creatures, such as demons, devils, and fey.</li><li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.ptBLVvRqn1fA3A4l]{Rope Shot} (Ranged Only)</strong> Your weapon can shoot projectiles that split into simple ropes or nets around your foes' legs to trip your targets, and you can climb using the grappling hooks built into the weapon. Your weapon innovation gains the climbing and ranged trip traits, as well as the tethered trait if it is thrown.</li><li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.WxkZMlETXo165XnC]{Tangle Line} (Thrown Only)</strong> Your weapon has an extensible line that you can use to knock your enemies over, recall the weapon to your hand and even parry attacks.

You are a spellcaster, and you can cast spells of the divine tradition using the Cast a Spell activity. As an oracle, when you cast spells, your incantations may spill from your lips rapidly as you speak in tongues or intone in a voice not quite your own, and your gestures might be wild and unrestrained as religious ecstasy briefly touches your mind.</p>\n<p>Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as an oracle, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast, as shown on the Oracle Spells per Day table (shown below).</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Charisma, your spell attack modifiers and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier.</p><h3>Heightening Spells</h3><p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p><h3>Cantrips</h3><p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of oracle spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level oracle, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level oracle, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p>"},"level":{"value":1},"prerequisites":{"value":[]},"publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Player Core 2"},"rules":[],"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["oracle"]},"slug":"oracle-spellcasting","_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"feat","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.7AVspOB6ITNzGFZi"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"7D8duG4ARFxLLm9F","img":"icons/creatures/mammals/bull-horns-eyes-glowin-orange.webp","name":"Majestic Will","system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"classfeature","description":{"value":"<p>Your mind and will are tempered by your mastery of magical forces.

You can light or extinguish your lantern as a free action once each turn with nothing but a thought, which has the concentrate trait. The lantern shines bright light out to 20 feet and dim light out 20 feet further; this has the evocation, light, and magical traits (the counteract rank against magical darkness is equal to half your level rounded up).</p>\n<p>The lantern's magical light attempts to reveal the unseen. You and your allies in the lantern's area of bright light gain a +1 status bonus to visual Perception checks to notice anything that is also within the bright light, and a +1 status bonus to checks to Recall Knowledge against creatures within the bright light, as the light exposes their true natures. During exploration, even if you aren't Searching, the GM rolls a secret check for you to find traps, environmental hazards, haunts, and secrets (such as secret doors). The GM rolls each time a given hazard or secret comes within 20 feet of you and within the lantern's bright light.

While you're holding your lantern, invisible and ethereal creatures within the bright light become visible as rippling distortions, though they're still @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed}. This doesn't give you any special ability to affect a creature on the Ethereal Plane, but it ensures you're aware of the creatures' presence.</p><h3><strong>Intensify Vulnerability</strong></h3><p>Your lantern's light flares and burns bright, leaving no shadows in which secrets and enemies can hide. Against the target of your Exploit Vulnerability, the status bonuses from the lantern's initiate benefit increase to +2. The creature takes a -2 status penalty to Deception checks and Stealth checks as long as it's within the lantern's light.

You are a spellcaster and can cast spells of the primal tradition using the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.aBQ8ajvEBByv45yz]{Cast a Spell} activity. As a druid, your spellcasting incantations might be pleas to the environment around you or the invocation of ancient vows; your hands might sway like willows or curl into clawlike shapes as your gestures direct your magic. At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the common spells on the primal spell list, or from other primal spells to which you gain access and learn via Learn a Spell. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare each day is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a druid, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in the Druid Spells per Day table.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Wisdom, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<h2>Heightening Spells</h2>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot.

A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of druid spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level druid, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and a 5th-level druid's are 3rd rank.</p>"},"level":{"value":1},"prerequisites":{"value":[]},"publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Player Core"},"rules":[],"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["druid"]},"slug":"druid-spellcasting","_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"feat","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.b8pnRxGuNzG0buuh"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"bAaI7h937Nr3g93U","img":"icons/equipment/head/helm-barbute-rounded-steel.webp","name":"Fighter Expertise","system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"classfeature","description":{"value":"<p>Your practiced techniques have made you even more formidable.

Your regalia aids you when you attempt to convince others. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Deception, Diplomacy, and Intimidation checks. Allies who can see you can use Follow the Expert to follow you even if you're only trained in a skill and not an expert, due to the competence you clearly exude.

The +1 status bonus now applies to all saving throws against mental effects, rather than only against fear, and you and allies in your aura gain a +2 status bonus to damage rolls. At 11th level, this increases to a +3 status bonus to damage rolls, and at 17th level, this increases to a +4 status bonus to damage rolls.</p><h3><strong>Intensify Vulnerability</strong></h3><p>Your regalia implement makes you seem more confident and inspiring with each success.

Choose one deity.</p><h2>Skill</h2><p>You become trained in the divine skill listed for your deity. As normal, if you're already trained in that skill, you become trained in a different skill of your choice.</p><h2>Anathema</h2><p>Champions care deeply about the edicts and anathema they take from their deity, sanctification, and cause. As with any implementation of edicts and anathema in the rules, these are a tool for roleplaying between you, the GM, and the other players at the table—you're still playing a nuanced character, not strictly following a script.</p>\n<p>Acts fundamentally opposed to your deity's ideals are anathema to your faith. Learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are anathema to your deity remove you from your deity's good graces.</p>\n<p>Similarly, using items, spells, or actions that are anathema to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your connection to your deity. For example, assisting with a ritual that raises undead would be anathema to Pharasma, the goddess of death. Many actions that are anathema don't appear in any deity's formal list. For borderline cases, you and your GM determine which acts are anathema.</p>\n<p>If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include your holy or unholy trait, your focus pool, and your blessing of the devoted. These abilities can be regained only if you repent by conducting an atone ritual. If your deity doesn't require the specific sanctification you had, your GM might let you retrain your sanctification and cause while still following the same deity.</p><h2>Sanctification</h2><p>Depending on your deity, their sanctification can make you holy or unholy. This commits you to one side of a struggle over souls. Whether you become holy, unholy, or neither will limit your choice of causes, devotion spells, and feats.</p>\n<p>If you \"can be\" holy or unholy according to your deity's sanctification entry, you make that choice, and if you \"must be\" holy or unholy, you gain the trait automatically. If the deity lists \"none,\" you can choose only options that don't require the holy or unholy trait. If you are holy or unholy and gain the opposing trait in some way, you lose the previous trait until you atone.</p>\n<p>Unholy sanctification for a champion can be extremely disruptive to a typical game and should be a player character option only in appropriate adventures or campaigns where the group collectively decides to embrace them. Unholy sanctification and causes are uncommon options.</p>\n<p><strong>Holy:</strong> You gain the holy trait and add that trait to any Strikes you make. You gain the edict, \"Do not knowingly harm innocents or fail to prevent harm to an innocent if your direct intervention could save them\" and the anathema \"Commit murder.\" Even if your game includes behavior outside the Pathfinder baseline, the acts listed there are anathema to you.</p>\n<p><strong>Unholy:</strong> You gain the unholy trait and add that trait to any Strikes you make. You gain the edict, \"Do not put another's needs before your own or those of your deity\" and the anathema \"Commit an entirely altruistic act, such as giving something away in charity\" and \"Put anyone's needs before those of your deity.\" None of these prevents you from performing acts others might consider helpful, but these acts must be done with the expectation that they ultimately further your own goals or those of your deity</p>"},"level":{"value":1},"prerequisites":{"value":[]},"publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Player Core 2"},"rules":[{"adjustName":false,"choices":{"filter":[{"or":["item:category:deity","item:category:pantheon","item:category:covenant"]}],"itemType":"deity"},"flag":"deity","key":"ChoiceSet","predicate":[{"not":"deity"}],"priority":99,"prompt":"PF2E.SpecificRule.Prompt.Deity"},{"allowDuplicate":false,"key":"GrantItem","predicate":[{"not":"deity"}],"uuid":"{item|flags.pf2e.rulesSelections.deity}"},{"adjustName":false,"choices":[{"label":"PF2E.TraitHoly","predicate":[{"or":["deity:primary:sanctification:can:holy","deity:primary:sanctification:must:holy"]}],"value":"holy"},{"label":"PF2E.TraitUnholy","predicate":[{"or":["deity:primary:sanctification:can:unholy","deity:primary:sanctification:must:unholy"]}],"value":"unholy"},{"label":"PF2E.NoneOption","predicate":[{"nor":["deity:primary:sanctification:must:holy","deity:primary:sanctification:must:unholy"]}],"value":"none"}],"key":"ChoiceSet","predicate":[{"nor":["sanctification:none","sanctification:holy","sanctification:unholy"]}],"prompt":"PF2E.SpecificRule.Prompt.Sanctification","rollOption":"sanctification","slug":"sanctification"},{"add":["{item|flags.pf2e.rulesSelections.sanctification}"],"key":"ActorTraits","predicate":[{"not":"sanctification:none"}]},{"key":"AdjustStrike","mode":"add","predicate":[{"not":"sanctification:none"}],"property":"traits","value":"{item|flags.pf2e.rulesSelections.sanctification}"},{"key":"GrantItem","predicate":["class:champion"],"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.FeBsYn2mHfMVDZvw"},{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.0x76o5OxgEmvqIDp"}],"subfeatures":{"proficiencies":{},"senses":{},"suppressedFeatures":[]},"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["champion"]},"slug":"deity-champion","_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"feat","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.ehL7mnkqxN5wIkgu"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"ejP4jVQkS48uKRFz","img":"icons/skills/melee/blade-tip-chipped-blood-red.webp","name":"Weapon Mastery","system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"classfeature","description":{"value":"<p><strong>Barbarian</strong> Your rage makes you even more effective with the weapons you wield.

You can focus this divine power through special items known as ikons. Ikons are items or bodily features intrinsically linked to you—sacred vessels forged from your divinity that are capable of conducting its power.</p>\n<p>By placing your divine spark into one of your ikons, you empower that ikon to accomplish deeds beyond what it could in mortal hands. Each ikon has both a passive immanence effect and an active transcendence effect. Both of these effects require your divine spark to be in the item. You can place your spark into an ikon by using the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.9cGJBXSJW6EpgibP]{Shift Immanence} action.</p><h3>Spark Transcendence</h3><p>While your spark dwells within an ikon, you get that ikon's immanence effect continually. However, you can also Spark Transcendence in a mighty deed, channeling your divinity through the ikon—though when you Spark Transcendence, the force of the act temporarily casts your divine spark out of the ikon. Each ikon's transcendence action appears in its stat block, and the transcendence trait is described in the Key Terms sidebar.</p><h3>Expanding <strong>Immanence</strong> And Transcendence</h3><p>Each ikon has one immanence and one transcendence ability when acquired, but you can imbue your ikons with additional abilities through higher-level exemplar class features and feats. These abilities have the ikon trait.</p><h2>Ikons</h2><p>As an exemplar, you select three ikons at first level. Typically, you will want to ensure at least one of your ikons is a weapon. Body ikons accentuate a physical trait of your body and so can't be stolen, disarmed, dispelled, or otherwise taken away. Weapon and worn ikons are tied to items of power. When you select one, you gain a non-magical, level-0 item of your choice that matches its usage entry. Providence ensures you come across these items; you might be traveling along a path to find a spear in a tree that only you can dislodge, or you might awaken holding a gleaming sash you saw in your dreams.</p>\n<p>Your ikons can be etched with runes, upgraded, or otherwise modified as normal for items of their type. A body or worn ikon can have runes etched on it to apply to your unarmed attacks as though it were handwraps of mighty blows, though only one of your ikons can have these runes and no ikon can have both these and armor or weapon runes.</p>\n<p>If you acquire a new item the ikon's usage could apply to, you can switch your ikon to the new item by spending 1 day of downtime with the new ikon as you saturate the object with your divine energy. You can use this process to make an existing magic item, like a cloak of illusions or a searing blade, into your ikon. If the item wasn't already a divine item, it becomes one for as long as it is your ikon, removing the arcane, occult, primal, or magical trait from the item and adding the divine trait. Artifacts, intelligent items, and other similarly powerful objects might resist your attempts to exert your divinity over them, with unpredictable results determined by the GM.</p>"},"level":{"value":1},"prerequisites":{"value":[]},"publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder War of Immortals"},"rules":[{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.9cGJBXSJW6EpgibP"},{"adjustName":false,"choices":{"filter":["item:tag:exemplar-ikon"]},"flag":"firstIkon","key":"ChoiceSet","prompt":"PF2E.SpecificRule.Exemplar.Ikon.Prompt"},{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"{item|flags.pf2e.rulesSelections.firstIkon}"},{"adjustName":false,"choices":{"filter":["item:tag:exemplar-ikon"]},"flag":"secondIkon","key":"ChoiceSet","predicate":["class:exemplar"],"prompt":"PF2E.SpecificRule.Exemplar.Ikon.Prompt"},{"key":"GrantItem","predicate":["class:exemplar"],"uuid":"{item|flags.pf2e.rulesSelections.secondIkon}"},{"adjustName":false,"choices":{"filter":["item:tag:exemplar-ikon"]},"flag":"thirdIkon","key":"ChoiceSet","predicate":["class:exemplar"],"prompt":"PF2E.SpecificRule.Exemplar.Ikon.Prompt"},{"key":"GrantItem","predicate":["class:exemplar"],"uuid":"{item|flags.pf2e.rulesSelections.thirdIkon}"},{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"override","path":"flags.pf2e.exemplar.ikons","priority":10,"value":[]}],"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["exemplar"]},"slug":"divine-spark-and-ikons","_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"feat","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.GtxSH6TudkQoKToW"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"gU7epgcPSm0TD1UK","img":"icons/equipment/back/cloak-collared-pink-gold.webp","name":"Defensive Robes","system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"classfeature","description":{"value":"<p>The flow of magic and your defensive training combine to help you get out of the way before an attack.

As an animist, your incantations might take the form of reciting relevant snippets of legends—stories passed down orally—or they might see you calling nearby spirits to honor ancient vows. Your gestures could be elegant dances or full-body convulsions as generations of memories and otherworldly energies inherited from your spiritual allies surge through you.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw).

Each day, you can prepare one 1st-rank spell and 2 cantrips from among the common spells on the divine spell list or from other divine spells you've gained access to and learned via Learn a Spell. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.

You gain additional spontaneous spell slots and a spell repertoire from your attuned apparitions. At first level, you can cast two apparition cantrips and one 1st-rank apparition spell per day. You must have the spell in your apparition spell repertoire to cast it; this is a collection of spells granted to you by all your attuned apparitions. You can cast any spell in your apparition spell repertoire by using an apparition spell slot of an appropriate spell rank.

This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. All your apparition spells are signature spells. That means that you can heighten any apparition spell freely by casting it from a higher-rank apparition spell slot, up to the maximum rank of apparition spell you can cast.</p><h3>Cantrips</h3><p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will any number of times per day.

Vessel spells are a type of focus spell. Because vessel spells are a manifestation of a specific apparition, an animist can't cast or Sustain a specific vessel spell in the same round they have already cast or Sustained it (for example, an animist who has cast earth's bile during their turn can't then cast or Sustain another instance of earth's bile during that same turn).</p>\n<p>It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point.

When you have already taken mild backlash in a given day, the next time you would take backlash, you take the moderate backlash instead, and if you have already taken moderate backlash, you take the severe backlash instead, and your deviation can't be used for the rest of the day—attempting to use it simply brings pain. When you make your daily preparations, your flat check DC returns to 5 and your next backlash returns to mild.</p>\n<p>Any effects from backlash can't be reduced, prevented, or otherwise bypassed.

At lower levels, you can tolerate only a modest amount of divine power, and your cursebound condition can't increase beyond cursebound 2; as you grow in levels, you can open yourself to even more power and your cursebound condition can progress to 3 and finally 4.

For instance, gouging claw would affect a creature beyond the reach of your hand if you used a weapon with reach, and frostbite would affect only a creature in your weapon's reach, even though the spell's range is longer.</p>\n<p><strong>Ancillary Effects</strong> Your spell still has any non-targeted effects that might affect creatures other than the target, as well as any ongoing effects starting from the moment you hit with the Strike. For example, scatter scree would still create difficult terrain in the target's space (as mentioned above) and tangle vine's circumstance penalty would last for its normal duration. The spell takes effect after the Strike deals damage; if the Strike has other special effects, the GM determines whether they happen before or after the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiple Defenses</strong> Any additional rolls after the initial spell attack still happen normally, such as the Fortitude save attempted by the target of a disintegrate spell. Similarly, a spell that allows you to attack with it again on subsequent rounds would only combine a Strike with its initial attack roll, not with any later ones. Invalid or Immune Target: If the target you hit wouldn't be a valid target for the spell, the spell is still expended but doesn't affect the target. If the target is immune to your attack but not the spell, it can still be affected by the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Variable Actions</strong> Some spells have different effects based on the number of actions you spend to cast them. You choose whether to use the effects of the 1- or 2-action version of the spell when you use Spellstrike. A spell has to take exactly 1 or 2 actions; you can't use Spellstrike with a spell that takes a free action, reaction, or 3 or more actions.</p>\n<p><strong>Spellshape</strong> You typically can't use spellshape with Spellstrike because spellshape actions require the next action you take to be Cast a Spell, and Spellstrike is a combined activity that doesn't qualify.</p>"},"level":{"value":1},"prerequisites":{"value":[]},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Secrets of Magic"},"rules":[{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.QDW9H8XLIjuW2fE4"}],"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["magus"]},"slug":"spellstrike","_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"feat","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.KVj5ofUwu3VJSrVw"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"KxpaxUSuBC7hr4F7","img":"icons/weapons/daggers/dagger-double-engraved-black.webp","name":"Exemplary Finisher","system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"classfeature","description":{"value":"<p>You execute your finishing moves with spectacular flair, adding special effects to your finishers.

If you force a foe to generate a surge, they are the origin point of that surge instead.</p>\n<p>If your wellspring was granted by a being like a god or muse, the entity's intentions might sometimes alter the results of wellspring surges, or move the point of origin for an area to any point within 30 feet if the GM determines this fits the situation. For example, instead of uncontrolled damage, the entity might choose to damage only creatures opposing its plan, even if they are your allies.</p>\n<p>A wellspring surge always has the trait of your magical tradition, plus any traits that appear in parentheses at the end of the surge's effects.</p>"},"level":{"value":1},"prerequisites":{"value":[{"value":"You must have a class that casts spells with a spell repertoire."}]},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Secrets of Magic"},"rules":[{"key":"Note","selector":"initiative","text":"PF2E.SpecificRule.WellspringMage.Initiative","title":"{item|name}"},{"key":"Note","outcome":["criticalSuccess"],"predicate":["wellspring-magic"],"selector":"flat-check","text":"PF2E.SpecificRule.WellspringMage.CriticalSuccess","title":"{item|name}"},{"key":"Note","outcome":["success"],"predicate":["wellspring-magic"],"selector":"flat-check","text":"PF2E.SpecificRule.WellspringMage.Success","title":"{item|name}"},{"key":"Note","outcome":["failure","criticalFailure"],"predicate":["wellspring-magic"],"selector":"flat-check","text":"PF2E.SpecificRule.WellspringMage.Failure","title":"{item|name}"},{"flag":"wellspringMageDedication","key":"GrantItem","predicate":[{"gte":["self:level",2]}],"reevaluateOnUpdate":true,"uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.Zyb3RMGyhsKfTjEG"},{"adjustName":false,"choices":{"filter":["item:tag:bard-muse",{"not":"item:tag:class-archetype"}]},"flag":"muses","key":"ChoiceSet","predicate":["class:bard"],"prompt":"PF2E.SpecificRule.Bard.Muse.Prompt"},{"key":"GrantItem","predicate":["class:bard"],"uuid":"{item|flags.pf2e.rulesSelections.muses}"},{"adjustName":false,"choices":{"filter":["item:tag:oracle-mystery",{"not":"item:tag:class-archetype"}]},"flag":"mystery","key":"ChoiceSet","predicate":["class:oracle"],"prompt":"PF2E.SpecificRule.Oracle.Mystery.Prompt"},{"key":"GrantItem","predicate":["class:oracle"],"uuid":"{item|flags.pf2e.rulesSelections.mystery}"},{"adjustName":false,"choices":{"filter":["item:tag:sorcerer-bloodline",{"not":"item:tag:class-archetype"}]},"flag":"bloodline","key":"ChoiceSet","predicate":["class:sorcerer"],"prompt":"PF2E.SpecificRule.Sorcerer.Bloodline.Prompt"},{"key":"GrantItem","predicate":["class:sorcerer"],"uuid":"{item|flags.pf2e.rulesSelections.bloodline}"}],"traits":{"otherTags":["bard-muse","class-archetype","oracle-mystery","sorcerer-bloodline"],"rarity":"common","value":[]},"slug":"wellspring-magic","_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"feat","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.mRvyq7G0rqRP1EAr"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"MtHLCQGD6OW98WC2","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/personal-barrier.webp","name":"Personal Barrier","system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"classfeature","description":{"value":"<p>Subtle telekinetic fields dampen and deflect incoming blows.

Magic also flows through this conduit from your eidolon into you, so your eidolon determines the type of spells you cast and the spell list you choose from (as described in Summoner Spellcasting on page 54).</p>\n<p>Choose a type of eidolon from the options starting on page 59 and other eidolons you have access to. When you choose your eidolon, you also determine its appearance and general form, within the parameters for that particular type of eidolon. Once you establish your eidolon's type and general appearance, these features can't be changed later, except by selecting special evolution feats that can cause your eidolon to develop new features.</p>\n<p>Your magical connection with your eidolon takes the form of a sigil on each of your bodies. As long as your eidolon is manifested, the sigil glows with light and can't be covered or disguised via any means; it will shine through clothing, appear over cloaks, and remain unaffected by obfuscating magic. This, combined with the way that the two of you clearly act in tandem, makes it readily apparent to an intelligent observer that the two of you are connected in some way, even if the person has never encountered a summoner before.</p>\n<p>You bring your eidolon into reality with the Manifest Eidolon action.</p>\n<p>Your eidolon is no mere minion. It doesn't have the minion or summoned trait, and the two of you work together and coordinate your actions. You and your eidolon share your actions and multiple attack penalty. Each round, you can use any of your actions (including reactions and free actions) for yourself or your eidolon.</p>\n<p>You coordinate your actions with your eidolon more efficiently when you Act Together. Your connection with your eidolon allows you to communicate with it telepathically at all times, even when it isn't manifested. You also gain the Share Senses action.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the connection between you and your eidolon means you both share a single pool of Hit Points. Damage taken by either you or the eidolon reduces your Hit Points, while healing either of you recovers your Hit Points. Like with your actions, if you and your eidolon are both subject to the same effect that affects your Hit Points, you apply those effects only once (applying the greater effect, if applicable). For instance, if you and your eidolon get caught in an area effect that would heal or damage you both, only the greater amount of healing or damage applies.</p>\n<h3>Gear and your Eidolon</h3>\n<p>Your eidolon can't wear or use magic items, except for items with the eidolon trait. An eidolon can have up to two items invested. Your eidolon's link to you means it can benefit from certain magic items invested by you.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your eidolon gains item bonuses to Perception and skills from any magical items that you have invested.</li>\n<li>Your eidolon increases its item bonus to AC based on your armor's armor potency rune or bracers of armor. It also gains an item bonus to its saves from the resilient rune on your armor or from your bracers of armor. Other permanent items that grant or increase item bonuses to AC and saves might convey a similar benefit, as determined by the GM.</li>\n<li>Your eidolon's Strikes benefit from the fundamental and property runes on your handwraps of mighty blows. Alternatively, you can Invest a magic weapon (even though magic weapons can't normally be Invested) to share its fundamental and property runes with your eidolon. You share these benefits only while you're holding the weapon, and you can have no more than one weapon invested in this way at a time. In either case, the eidolon gains only the benefits that can apply to its attacks, with the same limitations noted in handwraps of mighty blows.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Lost and Altered Actions</h3>\n<p>If you or your eidolon becomes slowed, stunned, quickened, or otherwise affected by something that changes the actions you gain at the start of each turn, it affects your shared actions. However, if you are both subject to such an effect, apply only the more severe one. For instance, if you or your eidolon were @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1}, you would start your turn with one fewer action, but if you were both slowed 1, you would still lose only one action, rather than adding the two slowed effects together. However, if you were slowed 1 and your eidolon @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 2}, you'd have two fewer actions, because that's the more severe effect. If only one of you becomes restricted in how you can spend your actions, that restriction doesn't automatically extend to the other; for example, if your eidolon became @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized} or petrified, it wouldn't be able to move, but you could still use your actions to move. The GM resolves any situation that's unclear.</p>\n<p>You, as the player, control both your summoner and your eidolon, and the two are generally considered to cooperate unless you decide for them not to. While a summoner's link with an eidolon is a partnership, ultimately the eidolon is linked to you, not the other way around. If there's ever a conflict of who should act, you win out over your eidolon. This means that if the eidolon comes under an effect that would take its actions out of your control, such as the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.yblD8fOR1J8rDwEQ]{Confused} or controlled condition, you can use all of your shared actions so your eidolon doesn't have any actions remaining to cause trouble (as long as you are able to act). However, if you came under such an effect, you would simply use all of your shared actions, preventing your eidolon from acting.</p>"},"level":{"value":1},"prerequisites":{"value":[]},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Secrets of Magic"},"rules":[{"allowDuplicate":false,"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.n5vwBnLSlIXL9ptp"},{"allowDuplicate":false,"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.2KV87ponbWXgGIhZ"},{"allowDuplicate":false,"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.3ZzoI9MTtJFd1Kjl"}],"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["summoner"]},"slug":"eidolon","_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"feat","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.qOEpe596B0UjhcG0"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"QOOwC3S41CKGkxlN","img":"icons/skills/ranged/arrow-flying-broadhead-metal.webp","name":"Vindicator","system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"classfeature","description":{"value":"<p>You have been specially trained to use guile and magic to reveal hidden threats.

You are a spellcaster, and you can cast spells of the arcane tradition using the Cast a Spell activity. As a wizard, when you cast spells, your incantations likely specify exactly what forces you call on and how to shape them, and your gestures precisely shape and direct your magic while circles of arcane runes flare to life.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-rank spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook (see below), as well as one extra curriculum cantrip and one extra curriculum spell of each rank you can cast from your arcane school. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a wizard, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest rank of spell you can cast, as shown in the Wizard Spells per Day table.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Intelligence, your spell attack modifier and spell DC use your Intelligence modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear on page 403.</p><h3>Heightening Spells</h3><p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks.</p><h3>Cantrips</h3><p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of wizard spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level wizard, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level wizard, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p><h3>Spellbook</h3><p>Every arcane spell has a written version, which you record in your personalized book of spells. You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less, which you receive for free and must study each day to prepare your spells. Your spellbook's form and name are up to you. It might be a musty, leather-bound tome or an assortment of thin metal disks connected to a brass ring; its name might be esoteric, like <em>The Tome of Silent Shadows</em> or something more academic, like <em>Advanced Pyromantic Applications of Jalmeri Elemental Theory</em>.</p>\n<p>The spellbook contains your choice of 10 arcane cantrips and five 1st-rank arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list or from other arcane spells you gain access to. You also add two 1st-rank spells from the curriculum of your arcane school (except in the case of the school of unified magical theory, as described in that school).</p>\n<p>Each time you gain a level, you add two arcane spells to your spellbook, of any spell rank for which you have spell slots, chosen from common spells of your tradition or others you gain access to. You can also add spells to your spellbook with the Learn a Spell activity. When you gain spell slots of a new rank, you also add an additional spell from your school's curriculum (unless it's the school of unified magical theory).</p>"},"level":{"value":1},"prerequisites":{"value":[]},"publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Player Core"},"rules":[{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.aBQ8ajvEBByv45yz"}],"traits":{"rarity":"common","selected":{},"value":["wizard"]},"slug":"wizard-spellcasting","_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"feat","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.S6WW4Yyg4XonXGHD"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"s8WEmc4GGZSHSC7q","img":"icons/magic/light/orb-hands-humanoid-yellow.webp","name":"Third Doctrine (Cloistered Cleric)","system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"classfeature","description":{"value":"<p>Your proficiency ranks for the spell attack modifier and spell DC statistics increase to expert.</p>"},"level":{"value":7},"prerequisites":{"value":[]},"publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Player Core"},"rules":[],"subfeatures":{"proficiencies":{"spellcasting":{"rank":2}}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["cleric"]},"slug":"third-doctrine-cloistered-cleric","_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"feat","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.s8WEmc4GGZSHSC7q"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"sa7BWfnyCswAvBVa","img":"icons/magic/light/orb-hands-humanoid-yellow.webp","name":"Second Doctrine (Cloistered Cleric)","system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"classfeature","description":{"value":"<p>Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p>"},"level":{"value":3},"prerequisites":{"value":[]},"publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Player Core"},"rules":[],"subfeatures":{"proficiencies":{"fortitude":{"rank":2}}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["cleric"]},"slug":"second-doctrine-cloistered-cleric","_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"feat","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.sa7BWfnyCswAvBVa"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"SB8UJ8rZmvbcBweJ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/powerful-fist.webp","name":"Powerful Fist","system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"classfeature","description":{"value":"<p>Your fists are deadly weapons.

Choose a revolutionary modification to apply to your innovation. You can also choose an initial or breakthrough modification of the same type instead, if you prefer.</p><h3>Revolutionary Armor Modifications</h3><ul><li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.HC99e4WoM36W3lrL]{Automated Impediments}:</strong> Your armor uses electromagnetic fields, subharmonic distortions, or other techniques to make it difficult for those close to you to move unless you allow it. While wearing your armor, all spaces adjacent to you are difficult terrain for your enemies.</li><li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.vUt71oX9QNLAUmZn]{Energy Barrier}:</strong> Your armor's defenses ablate any kind of energy coming your way. While wearing your armor, you gain resistance to all energy damage (acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, sonic, vitality, and void damage) equal to 2 + half your level. You must have the harmonic oscillator, metallic reactance, or phlogistonic regulator modification to select this modification.</li><li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.82rxCGBb5qf9fwbp]{Incredible Resistance}:</strong> You've improved upon your breakthrough modification's ability to resist damage. Choose one of the following breakthrough modifications your innovation has: dense plating, layered mesh, or tensile absorption. Increase the resistance you gain from that modification to be equal to your level, instead of half your level.</li><li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.ZrkyPG41iFicYsdX]{Multisensory Mask} (subterfuge suit only):</strong> You've built a multisensory mask over your armor that protects you by distorting your figure from all senses, leaving behind only a hazy image, muffled sounds, and so forth. While wearing the armor, you gain concealment against all creatures, even if they are using a nonvisual precise sense, such as a bat's echolocation. As normal for effects that leave your location obvious, you can't use this concealment to Hide or Sneak. If you use a hostile action, the concealment ends until you restore the mask as a single action, which has the manipulate trait.</li><li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.Q172fARBaNDR8Gqx]{Perfect Fortification} (power suit only):</strong> You've outfitted your armor with such heavy fortifications that deadly attacks often lose their edge. Each time you're critically hit while wearing the armor, attempt a DC 13 flat check. On a success, it becomes a normal hit. This isn't cumulative with <em>fortification</em> runes or other abilities that reduce critical hits with a flat check. Additionally, you gain resistance 2 + half your level against precision damage.</li><li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.8jELNQUBMAXUj3zR]{Physical Protections}:</strong> Your armor has so many adjustments and precautions that it can guard against all physical damage. While wearing your armor, you gain resistance to all physical damage (bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, as well as persistent bleed damage) equal to half your level. You must have the dense plating, layered mesh, or tensile absorption breakthrough modification to select this modification.</li><li><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.rYfmpMBy7wd1VHeO]{Rune Capacity}:</strong> Whether you've done some dabbling in orichalcum alloys or found another engineering solution, you've built your innovation in such a way that it can hold an additional property rune. Your innovation can have one more property rune than a normal item of its kind (to a maximum of four property runes with a +3 <em>potency</em> armor).</p></li></ul><h3>Revolutionary Construct Modifications</h3><ul><li><strong>Flight Chassis:</strong> You fit your construct with a means of flight, such as adding rotors or rebuilding it with wings and a lightweight construction. Your innovation gains a fly Speed of 25 feet.</li><li><strong>Miracle Gears:</strong> As you perfect your innovation's cortex, it becomes much more intelligent. Its Intelligence modifier increases by 2, and it learns a language of your choice from among the languages you know. Your construct gains the ability to use actions that require greater Intelligence, like @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.tHCqgwjtQtzNqVvd]{Coerce} and Decipher Writing. Finally, your construct becomes legendary in two Intelligence- or Charisma-based skills of your choice. You must have the marvelous gears modification to select this modification.</li><li><strong>Resistant Coating:</strong> Your innovation is hard to damage by any means. It gains resistance 5 to all damage (except adamantine).</li><li><strong>Runic Keystone:</strong> You've incorporated a device similar to a <em>runestone</em> into your innovation, allowing it to hold a property rune, even though it isn't a weapon or suit of armor. An armor property rune affects your innovation itself if it would affect the wearer of the armor. A weapon property rune grants whatever properties it would normally grant to a weapon to your innovation's unarmed attacks, following all the requirements as normal (for instance, a <em>vorpal</em> rune would only apply to slashing melee unarmed attacks); if the rune affects only ranged attacks, it has no effect unless your innovation has a built-in ranged attack (from the projectile launcher initial modification, for example). If the rune would affect the physical shape or appearance of the weapon or armor itself, like <em>raiment</em>, the rune has no effect when etched into your construct.</li><li><p><strong>Wall Configuration:</strong> Your innovation can transform from a mobile construct to a stationary battlefield emplacement. It can unfold as a 2-action activity that has the manipulate trait, changing from its usual form into a thin, straight wall of metal and gears up to 10 feet tall and 30 feet long. The wall must extend through your innovation's original space. While your construct is a wall, it can't take any actions except to use the same activity to transform back, and it can't defend itself easily, making it @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Off-Guard} and giving it an additional –2 status penalty to its AC. The wall blocks line of sight and effect unless your innovation has half its maximum HP or fewer, at which point holes in the wall allow creatures to see through and attack with cover, and Tiny creatures to slip through.</p></li></ul><h3>Revolutionary Weapon Modifications</h3><ul><li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.ZcoOMwEY8FX7UzMo]{Attack Refiner}:</strong> Your weapon makes minute recalibrations after every missed attack to ensure the next lands with vicious efficacy. Your innovation gains the backswing and forceful traits.</li><li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.KcK3d8zw0bCEoaEG]{Deadly Strike}:</strong> Through precise calculation, you've found the perfect way for your weapon to deal damage on a well-placed strike. Your innovation gains the deadly d8 trait. If your innovation was already deadly, increase the die by up to two die sizes (d6 to d10, d8 to d12), to a maximum of deadly d12.</li><li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.KmFz27FVNXYWwgIc]{Enhanced Damage}:</strong> You've made your innovation more powerful than other weapons of its kind. Increase your innovation's weapon damage die by one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12). As normal, you can't increase your die by more than one size, so this modification isn't cumulative with complex simplicity.</li><li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.YQs4G9YK3VskY2F6]{Extensible Weapon} (melee only):</strong> You've found a way to construct your weapon so that it can extend while leaving its balance unchanged. Your innovation gains the reach trait. If the weapon already had the reach trait, it increases your reach by an additional 10 feet, instead of the usual additional 5 feet.</li><li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.2xVLO3JDe4gYlqv4]{Impossible Alloy}:</strong> Other inventors claim it's not even technically possible, but you've managed to create several metal alloys that seem to work for only you. These alloys can damage opponents vulnerable to any one of the seven skymetals. Your innovation is treated as all seven skymetals (abysium, adamantine, djezet, inubrix, noqual, orichalcum, and siccatite). This means you deal more damage to a variety of creatures, though you don't apply any of the other special effects for weapons made of those skymetals.</li><li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.g9UMdKV1TxNdhpDO]{Momentum Enhancer}:</strong> A special device lets your weapon move with uncanny speed. Your innovation gains the agile trait; if it had the reload ability, you can reload once per round as a free action.</li><li><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.GoMoEtTu9uP7nxkg]{Omnirange Stabilizers} (ranged only):</strong> You've modified your innovation to be dangerous and effective at any range. If your innovation had the volley trait, remove the volley trait. Otherwise, increase your innovation's range increment by 50 feet or an amount equal to the weapon's base range increment, whichever is more.</li><li><p><strong>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.rYfmpMBy7wd1VHeO]{Rune Capacity}:</strong> Whether you've dabbled with orichalcum or found another engineering solution, you've built your innovation in such a way that it can hold an additional property rune. Your innovation can have one more property rune than a normal item of its kind (to a maximum of four property runes with a +3 <em>potency</em> weapon).</p>\n</li></ul>"},"level":{"value":15},"prerequisites":{"value":[]},"publication":{"license":"ORC","remaster":true,"title":"Pathfinder Guns &

As you advance as a thaumaturge, you will collect up to three implements and unlock the hidden potential stored within each, so you can mix and match their benefits to suit your situation.</p>\n<p>While your implements are your primary tools in your dealings with the supernatural, you know the value of always being prepared. You constantly collect and carry various smaller mystic objects, bits of materials with paranormal affinities, and items used in folk practices: your esoterica. These might include cold-iron nails, scraps of scrolls and scriptures, fragments of bones purportedly from a saint, and other similar objects.

You gain the Exploit Vulnerability action.</p>\n<p>You can attempt to Exploit Vulnerabilities in one of two ways: either by invoking properties that repel that type of creature, or by attempting a more improvisational, ad-hoc method with your esoterica that can impose a custom weakness on any creature, albeit one that usually isn't as dire as a creature's existing weakness.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mortal Weakness</strong> After identifying a creature's weakness, you use a thematically resonant bit of esoterica to attune your attacks to your discovery. Your unarmed and weapon Strikes activate the highest weakness you discovered with Exploit Vulnerability, even though the damage type your weapon deals doesn't change. This damage affects the target of your Exploit Vulnerability, as well as any other creatures of the exact same type, but not other creatures with the same weakness. For example, when fighting a pack of werewolves, you might use silver shavings or crushed moonstone to deal damage that applies their weakness to silver to your attacks against any of the werewolves, but you wouldn't apply this damage to any other monsters with a weakness to silver.</li>\n<li><strong>Personal Antithesis</strong> You improvise a custom weakness on a creature by forcefully presenting and empowering a piece of esoterica that repels it on an individual level; for instance, against a tyrant, you might procure a broken chain that once held a captive.

You can cast arcane spells using the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.aBQ8ajvEBByv45yz]{Cast a Spell} activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells.</p>\n<p>Because you're a magus, you can draw replacement sigils with the tip of your weapon or your free hand for spells requiring material components, replacing them with somatic components instead of needing a material component pouch.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can prepare one 1st-rank spell and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a magus, your number of spell slots and the highest rank of spells you can cast from spell slots increase. Because you split your focus between physical training and magical scholarship, you have no more than two spell slots of your highest rank and, if you can cast 2nd-rank spells or higher, two spell slots of 1 rank lower than your highest spell rank. For anything that requires the ability to cast spells of a certain rank that's lower than the highest slots you have, you still qualify even if you no longer have spell slots at those ranks.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p><h3>Heightening Spells</h3><p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they're heightened to certain ranks.</p><h3>Cantrips</h3><p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of spell you can cast as a magus. For example, as a 1st-level magus, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level magus, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p><h3>Spellbook</h3><p>Every arcane spell has a written version, usually recorded in a spellbook. You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less, which you receive for free and must study to prepare your spells each day. The spellbook contains your choice of eight arcane cantrips and four 1st-rank arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list or from other arcane spells you gain access to. Your spellbook's form and name are up to you. It might be anything from a sturdy book with a secure latch entitled Theses on the Stratagems of Supernatural Warfare to a tattered collection of training pamphlets with your name scrawled on the cover.</p>\n<p>Each time you gain a level, you add two more arcane spells to your spellbook, of any rank of spell you can cast. You can also use the Arcana skill to add other spells that you find in your adventures. Though you lose some lower spell slots as you increase in level, you keep the spells in your spellbook and can prepare them in your higher-rank slots as normal.</p>\n<p>If you have a spellbook from multiple sources (such as being a magus with the Wizard Dedication feat), you can use the same spellbook for all your spells.</p>"},"level":{"value":1},"prerequisites":{"value":[]},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Secrets of Magic"},"rules":[],"traits":{"rarity":"common","selected":{},"value":["magus"]},"slug":"arcane-spellcasting-magus","_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"feat","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.wXaz41gwqNtTn6tf"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"WxkZMlETXo165XnC","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/tangle-line.webp","name":"Tangle Line","system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"classfeature","description":{"value":"<p><strong>Thrown Only</strong></p><hr /><p>Your weapon has an extensible line that you can use to knock your enemies over, recall the weapon to your hand and even parry attacks.

To wield an element, you must have your kinetic aura active and have a free hand, as described in the impulse trait. You automatically gain the Elemental Blast and Base Kinesis impulses, and your kinetic gate selection gives you additional impulse feats. You can select more impulse feats with kineticist class feats, and at higher levels, you'll automatically get more with the gate's threshold class feature. You can select an impulse feat only if it matches one of your kinetic elements.</p>\n<p>Impulses are magical, and though they aren't spells, some things that affect spells also affect impulses. Abilities that restrict you from casting spells (such as being polymorphed into a battle form) or protect against spells (such as a spell that protects against other spells or a creature's bonus to saves against spells) also apply to impulses.</p>\n<h3><strong>Impulse Levels</strong></h3>\n<p>Any impulse you use is the same level you are. For instance, if you're 5th level, your Elemental Blast would be 5th level (and its counteract rank would be 3rd rank), even though you gained the action at 1st level.</p>\n<p>Similar to spells, many impulses get more powerful as you increase in level. In these cases, the impulse ends with one or more \"Level\" entries. This either lists the levels at which the impulse gets an upgrade or has an entry with a plus sign that describes a benefit that increases on a regular basis. For instance, a 1st-level impulse with a \"Level (+4)\" entry would get stronger at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.</p>\n<h3><strong>Impulse Attacks and DCs</strong></h3>\n<p>An impulse that requires a saving throw uses your kineticist class DC. Some of your impulses require you to attempt an <strong>impulse attack roll</strong> to see how effective they are. Your impulse attack roll uses the same proficiency and attribute modifier as your kineticist class DC. Like a spell attack modifier, your impulse attack modifier uses the following formula: d20 roll + attribute modifier + proficiency bonus + other bonuses + penalties. This means your impulse attack roll is typically 10 lower than your class DC. The @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.4D2KBtexWXa6oUMR]{Drained} condition can reduce your impulse attack rolls and class DCs. You can acquire a <em>gate attenuator</em> to gain a bonus to your impulse attack modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Elemental Blast</strong></h3>\n<p>The @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.6lbr0Jnv0zMB5uGb]{Elemental Blast} impulse is a simple expression of your power, allowing you to attack with the pure matter of your kinetic element.
