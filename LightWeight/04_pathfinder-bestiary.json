Nearly all other dragons look down on white dragons as hopelessly hotheaded and dull, though this does not make them any less dangerous-in fact, it may mean the opposite. It's nearly impossible to treat with white dragons, not because they lack the capacity to do so, but because they just don't care to. They are as difficult to deal with as they are quick to anger, and they become incensed at almost anything. When a white dragon does speak, it spews threats, inane jokes, and incoherent babbling as a prelude to attacking-and when the attack comes, it's bloody and relentless.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, white dragons prefer very cold, remote locations that are far from people. Dwelling on glacial mountaintops or in ice caverns beneath forbidding tundra, they treat the lands around them as their own personal hunting grounds. They fly out to feed or terrorize other creatures, especially those who trespass near the dragon's territory, then bring any treasure back to be displayed in icy niches in their lairs. They collect all kinds of valuables, with a slight preference for items with high utility-such as tools, trade goods, and fine food-over coins or jewels. The ability to shape ice lets white dragons rearrange their lairs exactly to their specifications, and they take great pride in how they've decorated their homes over the years.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty-be it by claw, tooth, or breath-and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"snow vision","mod":20,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"},{"acuity":"imprecise","range":60,"type":"scent"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":22},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":19},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":17}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":16},"arcana":{"base":15},"athletics":{"base":23},"intimidation":{"base":19},"stealth":{"base":18}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"lg"},"value":["chaotic","cold","dragon","evil"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.024PqcF8yMRBrPuq"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"0FGz2eXm0SB04sJW","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"joBYS96mXSnZC1WB","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Arcane Innate Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":39,"mod":0,"value":31},"tradition":{"value":"arcane"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"3yXFHbaL5gbiVZKx","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.OsOhx3TGIZ7AhD0P"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/dominate.webp","name":"Dominate","sort":200000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":{"save":{"basic":false,"statistic":"will"}},"description":{"value":"<p>You take command of the target, forcing it to obey your orders.

dragons are the most contemplative of the chromatic dragons as well as the most approachable. The key to understanding green dragons is to understand their obsession with knowledge and self-discipline. Any careful approach that takes advantage of a green dragon's fixations may end in a diplomatic outcome, but any misstep or slight can provoke a savage attack. Like most chromatic dragons, green dragons do not suffer fools-and the threshold for what they consider foolish is very low.</p>\n<p>Though more open than their chromatic cousins to dealing with other creatures and dragons, green dragons prefer an isolated and quiet life. They tend to lair in the most forbidding parts of a forest, surrounded by tangled thickets, or else at the heart of some dismal gulch. If the terrain is suitable, some green dragons make their home in natural caves, which they expand to suit their needs.</p>\n<p>Green dragons' pride leads them to see to the preservation of their forest homes. They feel that a verdant and lush forest is something that they alone have cultivated. This leads some green dragons to follow the path of druidism, though most prefer to study the arcane arts and occult lore. Most of them delve deeply into one particular field of study, and correspond with other scholars in the field by adopting a pen name that hides their true nature. Regardless of their chosen focus, green dragons seek to improve themselves, and their desire for knowledge makes them more likely to deal diplomatically with other creatures in order to obtain new information.</p>\n<p>Their hoards are typically well kept, organized, and filled with tomes of lore and scrolls of magic along with antiquities they collect for their own inscrutable reasons. Many of these treasures come from across the globe, and many an adventurer has survived an encounter with a green dragon by stroking its ego and plying it with rare artifacts or lost lore from ancient cultures.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty-be it by claw, tooth, or breath-and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":30,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"},{"acuity":"imprecise","range":60,"type":"scent"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":30},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":29},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":32}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":25},"arcana":{"base":32},"athletics":{"base":30},"deception":{"base":27},"diplomacy":{"base":31},"intimidation":{"base":31},"nature":{"base":28},"occultism":{"base":34},"society":{"base":31},"stealth":{"base":29,"note":"camouflage"}},"traits":{"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"grg"},"value":["amphibious","dragon","evil","lawful"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.0FGz2eXm0SB04sJW"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"0HjVFx8qIKDCfblg","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"xlUnQcjrxeMXu5Cd","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Divine Innate Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":17,"mod":0,"value":9},"tradition":{"value":"divine"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"mN2rMyaZQV7fbZC5","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.pkcOby5prOausy1k"},"img":"icons/sundries/gaming/playing-cards-black.webp","name":"Read Omens","sort":200000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":null,"description":{"value":"<p>You peek into the future.

Nearly all other dragons look down on white dragons as hopelessly hotheaded and dull, though this does not make them any less dangerous-in fact, it may mean the opposite. It's nearly impossible to treat with white dragons, not because they lack the capacity to do so, but because they just don't care to. They are as difficult to deal with as they are quick to anger, and they become incensed at almost anything. When a white dragon does speak, it spews threats, inane jokes, and incoherent babbling as a prelude to attacking-and when the attack comes, it's bloody and relentless.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, white dragons prefer very cold, remote locations that are far from people. Dwelling on glacial mountaintops or in ice caverns beneath forbidding tundra, they treat the lands around them as their own personal hunting grounds. They fly out to feed or terrorize other creatures, especially those who trespass near the dragon's territory, then bring any treasure back to be displayed in icy niches in their lairs. They collect all kinds of valuables, with a slight preference for items with high utility-such as tools, trade goods, and fine food-over coins or jewels. The ability to shape ice lets white dragons rearrange their lairs exactly to their specifications, and they take great pride in how they've decorated their homes over the years.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons.

Copper dragons are hedonists who are quick to indulge in simple pleasures, but they're also sympathetic to other creatures, slow to pass judgment, and careful to always examine a situation from as many perspectives as possible. This philosophy has its drawbacks, however, as copper dragons are susceptible to negative influences and prone to forgiving the less serious evil acts performed by their chromatic cousins and other cruel creatures. Copper dragons also have a difficult time keeping their temper in check once they are roused to anger.</p>\n<p>Copper dragons tend to lair in warm or temperate hills, but due to their nature, they move their lairs every few years. They sometimes live among other people, especially any dwarves who reside nearby. Some copper dragons even worship gods typically worshipped only by humanoids. Among these dragons, worship of Cayden Cailean is most popular, as they see his love of freedom and penchant for alcohol aligning with the typical copper dragon mindset.</p>\n<p>A copper dragon's combat tactics are as unorthodox as its sense of humor, as it is more likely to use mockery and tricks than outright strength to win its battles. As a copper dragon ages, it perfects jokes capable of rendering its foes helpless with laughter.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals' lives-and of their passing-always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don't seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water-though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other.</p>\n<p>In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts, other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes.

Their brand of evil is organized, manipulative, and regal. Blue dragons often lair near or within cities and set out to bend the population to their will and gather hordes of servants. These dragons love spinning webs of conspiracy. A blue dragon's lackeys typically don't even realize that they serve a dragon, but instead think the protection money, tariffs, or taxes they are amassing is treasure for a cruel but legitimate master. In some ways, blue dragons even see their servants as a living hoard and value them like treasure. These dragons have been known to use these tactics even with their own chromatic cousins.</p>\n<p>Not all blue dragons work clandestinely. Some lord over desert tribes and hill people like vengeful gods, demanding both tribute and worship. No matter how blue dragons manage their underlings, their bearing is regal and their lairs palatial; they're universally intolerant of insubordination, incompetence, and embezzlement, and punish perpetrators with murderous efficiency.</p>\n<p>Blue dragons are also known for their use and mastery of illusion magic. They make use of illusions to augment their manipulations and bewilder their foes in battle. Blue dragons also have some control over water, but use this ability to destroy water, something quite dangerous for those who encounter them in their desert lairs.</p>\n<p>The ideal lair for a blue dragon contains multiple passages, rooms, and secret chambers. As social creatures, blue dragons prefer to host guests in comfort-but their dwellings should not be so public that just anyone can come calling. A force of guards keeps out intruders, and clever illusions conceal the edifice from prying eyes. Rather than a pile of coins or gems, a blue dragon's true hoard is the rich furnishings in its citadel- expensive art, ornate furniture, and architectural marvels.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty-be it by claw, tooth, or breath-and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":31,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"},{"acuity":"imprecise","range":60,"type":"scent"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":32},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":30},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":33}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":28},"arcana":{"base":33},"deception":{"base":35},"diplomacy":{"base":35},"intimidation":{"base":33},"society":{"base":35},"stealth":{"base":28},"survival":{"base":29}},"traits":{"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"huge"},"value":["dragon","electricity","evil","lawful"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.4C3Sh2lO9oWi78Zo"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"4cPw8hZwW6uvyzvh","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"eqiwUtaFLOTC1oND","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Divine Innate Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":26,"mod":0,"value":18},"tradition":{"value":"divine"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"ArbkmxGrqRbaOPC3","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.VlNcjmYyu95vOUe8"},"img":"icons/magic/symbols/ring-circle-smoke-blue.webp","name":"Dimension Door","sort":200000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":null,"description":{"value":"<p>Opening a door that bypasses normal space, you instantly transport yourself and any items you're wearing and holding from your current space to a clear space within range you can see.

The key to understanding green dragons is to understand their obsession with knowledge and self-discipline. Any careful approach that takes advantage of a green dragon's fixations may end in a diplomatic outcome, but any misstep or slight can provoke a savage attack. Like most chromatic dragons, green dragons do not suffer fools-and the threshold for what they consider foolish is very low.</p>\n<p>Though more open than their chromatic cousins to dealing with other creatures and dragons, green dragons prefer an isolated and quiet life. They tend to lair in the most forbidding parts of a forest, surrounded by tangled thickets, or else at the heart of some dismal gulch. If the terrain is suitable, some green dragons make their home in natural caves, which they expand to suit their needs.</p>\n<p>Green dragons' pride leads them to see to the preservation of their forest homes. They feel that a verdant and lush forest is something that they alone have cultivated. This leads some green dragons to follow the path of druidism, though most prefer to study the arcane arts and occult lore. Most of them delve deeply into one particular field of study, and correspond with other scholars in the field by adopting a pen name that hides their true nature. Regardless of their chosen focus, green dragons seek to improve themselves, and their desire for knowledge makes them more likely to deal diplomatically with other creatures in order to obtain new information.</p>\n<p>Their hoards are typically well kept, organized, and filled with tomes of lore and scrolls of magic along with antiquities they collect for their own inscrutable reasons. Many of these treasures come from across the globe, and many an adventurer has survived an encounter with a green dragon by stroking its ego and plying it with rare artifacts or lost lore from ancient cultures.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty-be it by claw, tooth, or breath-and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":16,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"},{"acuity":"imprecise","range":60,"type":"scent"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":16},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":16},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":17}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":13},"arcana":{"base":16},"athletics":{"base":17},"deception":{"base":14},"diplomacy":{"base":16},"intimidation":{"base":16},"nature":{"base":14},"occultism":{"base":17},"society":{"base":14},"stealth":{"base":15}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"lg"},"value":["amphibious","dragon","evil","lawful"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.5XtCOknYJuEl4SfD"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"6UczvqBDlGNXcIlW","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"X0BfkEsL9YNikfyR","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Wave","sort":100000,"system":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"custom":"","value":["push-or-pull-10-feet"]},"bonus":{"value":21},"damageRolls":{"32s7wi2yo27n30jthu45":{"damage":"2d12+11","damageType":"bludgeoning"}},"description":{"value":""},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["reach-15"]},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"melee","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"xhqKU8Bdnig3dLJs","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Water-Bound","sort":200000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"interaction","description":{"value":"<p>When not touching water, the tidal master is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1} and can't use reactions.</p>"},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":[]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"action","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"WD2TqHcVPCybwkQT","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Vortex","sort":300000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"defensive","description":{"value":"<p>40 feet.

Even when standing erect on their stumpy legs, shamblers don't have much in the way of identifiable anatomy; they are tangles of parasitic vines that lash out at prey with their longest creepers, entwined together to deliver powerful blows. Sometimes called \"shambling mounds,\" these ambush predators have a particular fondness for flesh, and are most well known for their ability to hunker down and hide in plain sight. A shambler can draw nutrients from plant matter or soil, but won't do so if it suspects meat might soon wander near, and indeed may lie in wait for days in anticipation of such a meal.</p>\n<p>Shamblers are usually solitary creatures. Fierce thunderstorms are among the few events that bring numerous shamblers together. During such gatherings, the plants gather around strange but seemingly sacred earthen mounds in remote jungles and swamps and cavort and caper excitedly, stretching their tendrils toward the sky to hope for-or perhaps to summon-intense lightning strikes. Not only are these strange plants unharmed by even the most powerful electrical strikes, but they seem to become supernaturally empowered by such bursts of raw energy. Shamblers consider being struck by lightning a sign of divine favor, and those shamblers frequently blasted by bolts of electricity become respected elders among their kind.

These little constructs are created for a variety of reasons-such as to serve as companions or servants-but their free will means their obedience to their creators is hardly a given. Followers of Pharasma generally abhor soulbound dolls, viewing them as a perversion of the natural cycle of souls, and those who worship the Lady of Graves see the destruction of a soulbound doll, regardless of the construct's alignment, as an important service to the Great Beyond. Soulbound dolls are the simplest in a series of soulbound constructs including human-sized soulbound mannequins, powerful soulbound shells, and sentinel soulbound terra-cotta warriors. Creating them from unwilling living creatures is evil, and an unwilling donor can resist the process with a successful Will save against the creator's Craft DC, ruining the doll if not preventing the donor's death. A non-evil doll can only be crafted from the soul of a person who has given consent to such use before their death occurred</p>\n<p>Soulbound dolls encountered by adventurers are typically guardians of some sort; despite their diminutive size, the soul fragment's power makes the doll's flst more dangerous than a casual observer would expect. Further, it grants the doll a single spell of outsized power given its stature. Because of their autonomy and remarkable intelligence, soulbound dolls are occasionally employed by their crafters as administrators over much more powerful but mindless constructs such as golems, allowing such dolls to control defenses far beyond their own capabilities. Though soulbound dolls contain a small fragment of a soul extracted during or shortly after a person's death, this doesn't affect the deceased's resurrection or progress to the afterlife. This extraction process is lethal to otherwise-living prospective soul donors, though there are rumors of more expensive processes that allows someone to donate a fragment of a living soul without repercussions.</p>\n<p>The soul fragment resides in a soul focus gem typically embedded in the doll's neck or chest. The soul fragment isn't static, and the doll continues to learn from its initial state, meaning its personality and abilities can change, possibly growing closer to the donor's or moving farther afield on its own individual path. The soulbound doll's focus gem retains the doll's memories even after the doll's destruction. The the intact soul focus gem of a destroyed doll can even be placed into a new doll body by someone knowledgeable in the creation of soulbound creatures, effectively reconstituting the soulbound doll.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":8,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":7},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":10},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":6}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":8},"occultism":{"base":4},"stealth":{"base":8}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"tiny"},"value":["chaotic","construct","evil","soulbound"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.7EpLGBoddL8Vzlha"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"7ptWlh4t6oHvYOcj","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"a8iHr4CAafw5H0VD","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Occult Innate Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":18,"mod":0,"value":8},"tradition":{"value":"occult"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"2LPRoLUEmF3HyMko","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.fI20AVwOzJMHXRdo"},"img":"icons/magic/light/projectile-stars-blue.webp","name":"Levitate","sort":200000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":null,"description":{"value":"<p>You defy gravity and levitate the target 5 feet off the ground.

These little constructs are created for a variety of reasons-such as to serve as companions or servants-but their free will means their obedience to their creators is hardly a given. Followers of Pharasma generally abhor soulbound dolls, viewing them as a perversion of the natural cycle of souls, and those who worship the Lady of Graves see the destruction of a soulbound doll, regardless of the construct's alignment, as an important service to the Great Beyond. Soulbound dolls are the simplest in a series of soulbound constructs including human-sized soulbound mannequins, powerful soulbound shells, and sentinel soulbound terra-cotta warriors. Creating them from unwilling living creatures is evil, and an unwilling donor can resist the process with a successful Will save against the creator's Craft DC, ruining the doll if not preventing the donor's death. A non-evil doll can only be crafted from the soul of a person who has given consent to such use before their death occurred</p>\n<p>Soulbound dolls encountered by adventurers are typically guardians of some sort; despite their diminutive size, the soul fragment's power makes the doll's flst more dangerous than a casual observer would expect. Further, it grants the doll a single spell of outsized power given its stature. Because of their autonomy and remarkable intelligence, soulbound dolls are occasionally employed by their crafters as administrators over much more powerful but mindless constructs such as golems, allowing such dolls to control defenses far beyond their own capabilities. Though soulbound dolls contain a small fragment of a soul extracted during or shortly after a person's death, this doesn't affect the deceased's resurrection or progress to the afterlife. This extraction process is lethal to otherwise-living prospective soul donors, though there are rumors of more expensive processes that allows someone to donate a fragment of a living soul without repercussions.</p>\n<p>The soul fragment resides in a soul focus gem typically embedded in the doll's neck or chest. The soul fragment isn't static, and the doll continues to learn from its initial state, meaning its personality and abilities can change, possibly growing closer to the donor's or moving farther afield on its own individual path. The soulbound doll's focus gem retains the doll's memories even after the doll's destruction. The the intact soul focus gem of a destroyed doll can even be placed into a new doll body by someone knowledgeable in the creation of soulbound creatures, effectively reconstituting the soulbound doll.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":8,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":7},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":10},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":6}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":8},"occultism":{"base":4},"stealth":{"base":8}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"tiny"},"value":["construct","evil","soulbound"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.7ptWlh4t6oHvYOcj"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"93hZtLl9pRRfqI05","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"RJHEA3Ugy5eo8bGd","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Arcane Spontaneous Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"spontaneous"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{"slot1":{"max":4,"value":4}},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":20,"mod":0,"value":12},"tradition":{"value":"arcane"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"NtjyRhD8SgNaz3FZ","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.gpzpAAAJ1Lza2JVl"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/detect-magic.webp","name":"Detect Magic","sort":200000,"system":{"area":{"type":"emanation","value":30},"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":null,"description":{"value":"<p>You send out a pulse that registers the presence of magic.

Though kobolds are far more pragmatic than they are courageous, they use every inch of their cunning to even the playing field between themselves and other, stronger creatures. They attack from the darkness and at range, and kobold artificers and engineers master the art of simple but effective traps, which they use to protect their lairs. Kobolds are skilled at working together by necessity, and they often set up ambushes or hit-and-run assaults that allow them to do the most damage possible without being harmed in return.</p>\n<p>Kobolds are diligent and hardworking creatures, though they often turn these virtues toward selfish ends. While some kobolds live in communal collectives that maintain neutral relations with the creatures around them, they can be easily swayed into serving malevolent powers or megalomaniac leaders. This is in part due to kobolds' innate pragmatism, as they would rather concede to servitude than risk being killed, but it is also in part due to a reverence for the power that kobolds generally lack. Dragons in particular are viewed with a deferential awe, and kobolds eagerly offer their services to such mighty and glorious creatures when they can. While kobolds may scheme against other leaders, especially those that control them via subjugation, dragons are usually viewed with adoration, no matter how brutal they might be to their kobold minions.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":5,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":4},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":7},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":7}},"skills":{"arcana":{"base":6},"deception":{"base":8},"diplomacy":{"base":8},"intimidation":{"base":8},"stealth":{"base":7}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"sm"},"value":["evil","humanoid","kobold","lawful"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.93hZtLl9pRRfqI05"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"9H11QHnoKz8hHKSM","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"qaEGHfAlvrP6CGwS","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Arcane Innate Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":42,"mod":0,"value":34},"tradition":{"value":"arcane"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"y3WGfwZSPUcdAfcZ","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.qwlh6aDgi86U3Q7H"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/suggestion.webp","name":"Suggestion (At Will)","sort":200000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":{"save":{"basic":false,"statistic":"will"}},"description":{"value":"<p>Your honeyed words are difficult for creatures to resist.

On the Abyss, balors serve demon lords as generals or captains, and they typically command vast legions of demons. Standing at 14 feet in height, only the cruelest mortal souls-those who devoted entire lives to sins too numerous to count-can fuel the formation of a balor. More often, a balor forms from a mass of dozens of mortal souls who shared debased ideologies in life.</p>\n<h4>Balor Lords</h4>\n<p>Those rare few balors who form from single souls are the ones most likely to eventually transcend the notable power they already wield, becoming a nascent demon lord. These balor lords are each unique creatures of 21st to 25th level in power who rule their own realm in the Abyss. In time, a balor lord can further develop into a unique creature with wildly different powers, even ascending to the role of a true demon lord.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>When a sinful mortal soul is judged and sent on to the Abyss, it can become a deadly fiend-a demon. Demons are living incarnations of sin-be they classic sins like wrath or gluttony, or more \"specialized\" depravities like an obsession with torture or the act of treason or treachery.

They command the unwavering reverence of all other metallic dragons, who view gold dragons as their leaders and counselors. Golds rival the raw power of even red dragons, much to the chagrin of their chromatic cousins, and the two races are often regarded as bitter rivals. But despite their incredible power, gold dragons are fond of discourse and prefer to talk through solutions to problems rather than rely upon brute strength. Long-lived as they are, they necessarily take a wide view of all situations and never act without considering all possible options and outcomes. Because of this, gold dragons willingly converse with any creature that seeks them out, even evil chromatic dragons. Mortals might find this behavior strange, considering the long-standing war between chromatic and metallic dragons, but dragons know all too well that desperate situations sometimes call for drastic alliances. And although gold dragons might consider brief truces with their chromatic brethren in the case of world-ending threats, they also know when such alliances have run their course.</p>\n<p>When another metallic dragon faces a quandary or a foe beyond its own ability to overcome, its best option is often to seek the counsel of the eternally wise and gloriously righteous gold dragons. Locating these legendary beings is no easy task, however, for gold dragons are notoriously reclusive. Their intellect and wisdom is such that they prefer to ponder the great questions of life in seclusion, where they strive to formulate solutions to the world's most pressing problems. As a result, gold dragons are sometimes absent when metallic dragons gather together, or are missing from tribunals where their counsel would be beneficial. Impatient dragons sometimes begrudge gold dragons for this apparent unreliability, but such aspersions are usually a result of jealousy rather than any true criticism; in their hearts, other dragons know that few gold dragons purposefully exclude themselves from truly important matters.</p>\n<p>A gold dragon's incredible foresight and unparalleled enlightenment means they are unlikely to interfere in the business of individual mortals, though the rare person who captures the attention of a gold dragon is fortunate indeed, for there are few beings in the cosmos who can offer such prudent and considerate advice. Rulers and individuals in stations of high power have an easier time of garnering the aid of a gold dragon; entire wars have been avoided thanks to a gold dragon's last-minute intermediation.</p>\n<p>Gold dragons are often found in warm grasslands and savannas, lands where they can enjoy long, meditative flights without attracting the attention of potential enemies. They tend to sleep either out in the open in a barren, remote place, or within a heavily secreted or fortified lair, such as a forgotten sink hole or in the labyrinthine caverns of a terrestrial chasm. Gold dragons may enlist trusted servants and allies to guard their lairs, though many live truly solitary lives, preferring to protect their hoards with nonlethal traps and magical wards.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals' lives-and of their passing-always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don't seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water-though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other. In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts, other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes. Countless other types of dragons are sure to exist, including dragons on far-flung planes of existence and, it is rumored, primeval dragons who soar between the stars.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":21,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"},{"acuity":"imprecise","range":60,"type":"scent"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":22},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":20},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":22}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":17},"arcana":{"base":18},"athletics":{"base":23},"diplomacy":{"base":23},"medicine":{"base":21},"religion":{"base":21},"society":{"base":18}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"lg"},"value":["dragon","fire","good","lawful"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.9xdl2PpfMEfJWhSO"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"aAiuQvMGPN9QXwKY","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"iySuinX75ehOzFDa","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Arcane Innate Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":35,"mod":0,"value":27},"tradition":{"value":"arcane"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"sDTJUbWSgKFGLPww","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.a3aQxCpoj1q1NQxC"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/sunburst.webp","name":"Sunburst","sort":200000,"system":{"area":{"type":"burst","value":60},"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":true,"damage":{"0":{"category":null,"formula":"8d10","kinds":["damage"],"materials":[],"type":"fire"}},"defense":{"save":{"basic":false,"statistic":"reflex"}},"description":{"value":"<p>A powerful globe of searing sunlight explodes in the area, dealing 8d10 fire damage to all creatures in the area, plus 8d10 additional vitality damage to undead creatures.

They command the unwavering reverence of all other metallic dragons, who view gold dragons as their leaders and counselors. Golds rival the raw power of even red dragons, much to the chagrin of their chromatic cousins, and the two races are often regarded as bitter rivals. But despite their incredible power, gold dragons are fond of discourse and prefer to talk through solutions to problems rather than rely upon brute strength. Long-lived as they are, they necessarily take a wide view of all situations and never act without considering all possible options and outcomes. Because of this, gold dragons willingly converse with any creature that seeks them out, even evil chromatic dragons. Mortals might find this behavior strange, considering the long-standing war between chromatic and metallic dragons, but dragons know all too well that desperate situations sometimes call for drastic alliances. And although gold dragons might consider brief truces with their chromatic brethren in the case of world-ending threats, they also know when such alliances have run their course.</p>\n<p>When another metallic dragon faces a quandary or a foe beyond its own ability to overcome, its best option is often to seek the counsel of the eternally wise and gloriously righteous gold dragons. Locating these legendary beings is no easy task, however, for gold dragons are notoriously reclusive. Their intellect and wisdom is such that they prefer to ponder the great questions of life in seclusion, where they strive to formulate solutions to the world's most pressing problems. As a result, gold dragons are sometimes absent when metallic dragons gather together, or are missing from tribunals where their counsel would be beneficial. Impatient dragons sometimes begrudge gold dragons for this apparent unreliability, but such aspersions are usually a result of jealousy rather than any true criticism; in their hearts, other dragons know that few gold dragons purposefully exclude themselves from truly important matters.</p>\n<p>A gold dragon's incredible foresight and unparalleled enlightenment means they are unlikely to interfere in the business of individual mortals, though the rare person who captures the attention of a gold dragon is fortunate indeed, for there are few beings in the cosmos who can offer such prudent and considerate advice. Rulers and individuals in stations of high power have an easier time of garnering the aid of a gold dragon; entire wars have been avoided thanks to a gold dragon's last-minute intermediation.</p>\n<p>Gold dragons are often found in warm grasslands and savannas, lands where they can enjoy long, meditative flights without attracting the attention of potential enemies. They tend to sleep either out in the open in a barren, remote place, or within a heavily secreted or fortified lair, such as a forgotten sink hole or in the labyrinthine caverns of a terrestrial chasm. Gold dragons may enlist trusted servants and allies to guard their lairs, though many live truly solitary lives, preferring to protect their hoards with nonlethal traps and magical wards.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals' lives-and of their passing-always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don't seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water-though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other. In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts, other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes. Countless other types of dragons are sure to exist, including dragons on far-flung planes of existence and, it is rumored, primeval dragons who soar between the stars.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder

At that point, they begin to feed, eating their quarry alive.</p>\n<p>Chuuls can live in fresh or saltwater, and indeed are found in aquatic environs the world over-even in the subterranean oceans and lakes of the Darklands. While chuuls are good swimmers, they prefer terrestrial prey. Their preferred method of hunting is by lunging out of the water, paralyzing their victims with their poison-coated tentacles, then gleefully dragging their twitching food into the water to drown if they cannot simply eat such morsels alive. Chuuls that dwell aboveground prefer to dine on lizardfolk, while those swimming the subterranean lakes of the Darklands readily eat anything but xulgaths, whose flavor and stink they find off-putting.</p>\n<p>Chuuls are capable of speech and reason, but these creatures rarely speak with those outside their species except to taunt their food.

Guardian nagas believe that the beautiful elements of the cosmos are worthy of protection and that devotion to such a grand effort is its own reward. A guardian naga may join a group with similar values, such as a sect of priests or monks, to aid it in its holy endeavors and to exchange knowledge of the heavens.</p>\n<p>Guardian nagas usually encourage their young, upon reaching adulthood, to depart the nest and seek out their own natural wonders or ancient ruins to protect. Sometimes generations of guardian nagas might guard the same place, passing the honor of such care from parent to child. In such cases, the parent nagas aim to have at least one of their children elect to stay behind and become the guardian of their ancestral ward, giving the parents the peace of mind that the site they protect will continue to be guarded by their descendants.</p>\n<p>It is difficult for many societies that vilify serpents or see them as symbols of evil to accept the fact that guardian nagas are benevolent and kindly. Fortunately for these people, guardian nagas are also patient and understanding, and see encounters with such societies as opportunities to educate and expand worldviews.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Nagas are serpentine beings with magical powers and keen, nearly inscrutable intellects. Physically, they resemble massive snakes with eerie visages that resemble those of humans. Nagas use their innate magic and poisonous fangs to keep all but the most stalwart foes at bay. Beyond the natural weapons they use to ward away foes, little is understood of the naga's unsettling physiology.</p>\n<p>Nagas are intelligent creatures with powerful needs to pursue, be they the accumulation of knowledge, the collection of rare art, or the rule of an entire nation. On Golarion, the nation of Nagajor is one such society-an entire empire ruled by nagas and populated by reptilian humanoids who serve their naga rulers with a patriotic pride that borders on worship.</p>\n<p>Still, most adventurers interact with nagas on a much smaller scale, encountering them as dangerous guardians in remote locations or not-so-abandoned ruins. In many cases, these nagas have heard of distant Nagajor, but they are usually unwilling to abandon their own pursuits to seek out a land where they might be worshipped as gods.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":22,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":20},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":21},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":22}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":22},"deception":{"base":18},"diplomacy":{"base":21},"stealth":{"base":20}},"traits":{"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"lg"},"value":["aberration","good","lawful"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.aq2H1lRALUNMEGRG"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"aqW5sp9HPgZgpXxs","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"YJR2VSzinZXYbwkd","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.kdGqnqbrwPzQfTsm"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/equipment/weapons/greatclub.webp","name":"Greatclub","sort":100000,"system":{"baseItem":"greatclub","bonus":{"value":0},"bonusDamage":{"value":0},"bulk":{"value":2},"category":"martial","containerId":null,"damage":{"damageType":"bludgeoning","dice":1,"die":"d10"},"description":{"value":"<p>While many greatclubs are intricately carved, others are little more than a sturdy tree branch.

Their brand of evil is organized, manipulative, and regal. Blue dragons often lair near or within cities and set out to bend the population to their will and gather hordes of servants. These dragons love spinning webs of conspiracy. A blue dragon's lackeys typically don't even realize that they serve a dragon, but instead think the protection money, tariffs, or taxes they are amassing is treasure for a cruel but legitimate master. In some ways, blue dragons even see their servants as a living hoard and value them like treasure. These dragons have been known to use these tactics even with their own chromatic cousins.</p>\n<p>Not all blue dragons work clandestinely. Some lord over desert tribes and hill people like vengeful gods, demanding both tribute and worship. No matter how blue dragons manage their underlings, their bearing is regal and their lairs palatial; they're universally intolerant of insubordination, incompetence, and embezzlement, and punish perpetrators with murderous efficiency.</p>\n<p>Blue dragons are also known for their use and mastery of illusion magic. They make use of illusions to augment their manipulations and bewilder their foes in battle. Blue dragons also have some control over water, but use this ability to destroy water, something quite dangerous for those who encounter them in their desert lairs.</p>\n<p>The ideal lair for a blue dragon contains multiple passages, rooms, and secret chambers. As social creatures, blue dragons prefer to host guests in comfort-but their dwellings should not be so public that just anyone can come calling. A force of guards keeps out intruders, and clever illusions conceal the edifice from prying eyes. Rather than a pile of coins or gems, a blue dragon's true hoard is the rich furnishings in its citadel- expensive art, ornate furniture, and architectural marvels.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty-be it by claw, tooth, or breath-and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":18,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"},{"acuity":"imprecise","range":60,"type":"scent"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":19},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":18},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":19}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":15},"arcana":{"base":16},"deception":{"base":18},"diplomacy":{"base":18},"intimidation":{"base":18},"society":{"base":16},"stealth":{"base":15},"survival":{"base":16}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"lg"},"value":["dragon","electricity","evil","lawful"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.ar0tszs8NAgQamHX"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"ASc5sT2hU84tp1fx","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"G4HjijhXg27QNTqn","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Divine Innate Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":42,"mod":0,"value":34},"tradition":{"value":"divine"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"YVVG8L5RcZQrZQIC","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.E3X2RbzWHCdz7gsk"},"img":"icons/magic/fire/explosion-embers-orange.webp","name":"Flame Strike","sort":200000,"system":{"area":{"details":"10-foot radius, 40-foot-tall cylinder","type":"cylinder","value":10},"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{"0":{"applyMod":false,"category":null,"formula":"8d6","kinds":["damage"],"materials":[],"type":"fire"}},"defense":{"save":{"basic":true,"statistic":"reflex"}},"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Area:</strong> 10-foot radius, 40-foot-tall cylinder</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You call a rain of divine fire that plummets down from above, dealing 8d6 fire damage.

first fleshwarping process mastered by the drow remains both their most successful and most infamous: the drider. Fusing the body of a drow with that of a giant spider, driders are a sexually dimorphic fleshwarp-the only fleshwarp known to be able to produce young. While female driders have the upper torsos of elegant drow women with mouths featuring sharp poisoned fangs, male driders have hideous, mutated countenances that further blend the humanoid form with that of a spider; the difference in appearance is perhaps a reflection on the matriarchal nature of drow society. In combat, all driders are equally dangerous.</p>\n<p>Although the fleshwarping process was originally intended to be a punishment for drow who fell from grace, the significant powers and strengths gained from the horrifying transformation are attractive to some drow, and an increasing number of lower-ranking citizens in drow cities volunteer themselves for the painful procedure. In return for mandatory time serving as a guardian, soldier, or other public servant, such volunteer driders are later allowed to lead their own lives, typically in caverns located in a city's periphery. The painful truth is that for most driders, they do not live long enough to see this reward, for the drow have a penchant for working their fleshwarped slaves to death or deploying them in deadly war missions in which survival is a only a remote possibility.</p>\n<p>Most driders use arcane magic, but driders who use divine magic are well known, while a rare few use occult or primal magic. A drider's innate spells remain the same regardless of the magical tradition, but those who use different types of magic as prepared spells may well have entirely different spells prepared than the drider presented below.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Some creatures, notably drow, are not happy with merely killing their enemies. They revel in the total degradation of their foes through the horrifying transformative technique known as fleshwarping.

Copper dragons are hedonists who are quick to indulge in simple pleasures, but they're also sympathetic to other creatures, slow to pass judgment, and careful to always examine a situation from as many perspectives as possible. This philosophy has its drawbacks, however, as copper dragons are susceptible to negative influences and prone to forgiving the less serious evil acts performed by their chromatic cousins and other cruel creatures. Copper dragons also have a difficult time keeping their temper in check once they are roused to anger.</p>\n<p>Copper dragons tend to lair in warm or temperate hills, but due to their nature, they move their lairs every few years. They sometimes live among other people, especially any dwarves who reside nearby. Some copper dragons even worship gods typically worshipped only by humanoids. Among these dragons, worship of Cayden Cailean is most popular, as they see his love of freedom and penchant for alcohol aligning with the typical copper dragon mindset.</p>\n<p>A copper dragon's combat tactics are as unorthodox as its sense of humor, as it is more likely to use mockery and tricks than outright strength to win its battles. As a copper dragon ages, it perfects jokes capable of rendering its foes helpless with laughter.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals' lives-and of their passing-always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don't seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water-though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other.</p>\n<p>In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts, other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes.

After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water-though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other.</p>\n<p>In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts, other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes. Countless other types of dragons are sure to exist, including dragons on far-flung planes of existence and, it is rumored, primeval dragons who soar between the stars.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":32,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"},{"acuity":"imprecise","range":100,"type":"scent"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":32},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":30},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":34}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":28},"arcana":{"base":35},"athletics":{"base":34},"diplomacy":{"base":32},"intimidation":{"base":32},"occultism":{"base":33},"society":{"base":33},"stealth":{"base":28}},"traits":{"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"grg"},"value":["amphibious","dragon","good","lawful","water"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.BzBFDaNj51PP97RZ"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"c0zqasudrwZU3fdw","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"6HOLWC4q1wPrnZql","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Arcane Innate Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":29,"mod":0,"value":19},"tradition":{"value":"arcane"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"iRnNuTXaYCxU3pTc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.5bTt2CvYHPvaR7QQ"},"img":"icons/magic/lightning/bolt-strike-explosion-purple.webp","name":"Plane Shift (At Will) (to Astral Plane, Elemental Planes, or Material Plane Only)","sort":200000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":null,"description":{"value":"<p>You and your allies traverse the barriers between planes of existence.

They lurk in dark spaces, usually tunnels and mines beneath the earth, in either warrens of their own design or complexes discovered and colonized after the original builders have moved on. Though kobolds are far more pragmatic than they are courageous, they use every inch of their cunning to even the playing field between themselves and other, stronger creatures. They attack from the darkness and at range, and kobold artificers and engineers master the art of simple but effective traps, which they use to protect their lairs. Kobolds are skilled at working together by necessity, and they often set up ambushes or hit-and-run assaults that allow them to do the most damage possible without being harmed in return.</p>\n<p>Kobolds are diligent and hardworking creatures, though they often turn these virtues toward selfish ends. While some kobolds live in communal collectives that maintain neutral relations with the creatures around them, they can be easily swayed into serving malevolent powers or megalomaniac leaders. This is in part due to kobolds' innate pragmatism, as they would rather concede to servitude than risk being killed, but it is also in part due to a reverence for the power that kobolds generally lack. Dragons in particular are viewed with a deferential awe, and kobolds eagerly offer their services to such mighty and glorious creatures when they can.

It's nearly impossible to treat with white dragons, not because they lack the capacity to do so, but because they just don't care to.

They fly out to feed or terrorize other creatures, especially those who trespass near the dragon's territory, then bring any treasure back to be displayed in icy niches in their lairs. They collect all kinds of valuables, with a slight preference for items with high utility-such as tools, trade goods, and fine food-over coins or jewels.

Bulette pairs share territory and mate for life-a mated pair of bulettes being the only known exception to the creature's penchant for solitude. They rear their young for a short period of time.

They command the unwavering reverence of all other metallic dragons, who view gold dragons as their leaders and counselors. Golds rival the raw power of even red dragons, much to the chagrin of their chromatic cousins, and the two races are often regarded as bitter rivals. But despite their incredible power, gold dragons are fond of discourse and prefer to talk through solutions to problems rather than rely upon brute strength. Long-lived as they are, they necessarily take a wide view of all situations and never act without considering all possible options and outcomes. Because of this, gold dragons willingly converse with any creature that seeks them out, even evil chromatic dragons. Mortals might find this behavior strange, considering the long-standing war between chromatic and metallic dragons, but dragons know all too well that desperate situations sometimes call for drastic alliances. And although gold dragons might consider brief truces with their chromatic brethren in the case of world-ending threats, they also know when such alliances have run their course.</p>\n<p>When another metallic dragon faces a quandary or a foe beyond its own ability to overcome, its best option is often to seek the counsel of the eternally wise and gloriously righteous gold dragons. Locating these legendary beings is no easy task, however, for gold dragons are notoriously reclusive. Their intellect and wisdom is such that they prefer to ponder the great questions of life in seclusion, where they strive to formulate solutions to the world's most pressing problems. As a result, gold dragons are sometimes absent when metallic dragons gather together, or are missing from tribunals where their counsel would be beneficial. Impatient dragons sometimes begrudge gold dragons for this apparent unreliability, but such aspersions are usually a result of jealousy rather than any true criticism; in their hearts, other dragons know that few gold dragons purposefully exclude themselves from truly important matters.</p>\n<p>A gold dragon's incredible foresight and unparalleled enlightenment means they are unlikely to interfere in the business of individual mortals, though the rare person who captures the attention of a gold dragon is fortunate indeed, for there are few beings in the cosmos who can offer such prudent and considerate advice. Rulers and individuals in stations of high power have an easier time of garnering the aid of a gold dragon; entire wars have been avoided thanks to a gold dragon's last-minute intermediation.</p>\n<p>Gold dragons are often found in warm grasslands and savannas, lands where they can enjoy long, meditative flights without attracting the attention of potential enemies. They tend to sleep either out in the open in a barren, remote place, or within a heavily secreted or fortified lair, such as a forgotten sink hole or in the labyrinthine caverns of a terrestrial chasm. Gold dragons may enlist trusted servants and allies to guard their lairs, though many live truly solitary lives, preferring to protect their hoards with nonlethal traps and magical wards.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals' lives-and of their passing-always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don't seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water-though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other. In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts, other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes. Countless other types of dragons are sure to exist, including dragons on far-flung planes of existence and, it is rumored, primeval dragons who soar between the stars.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":21,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"},{"acuity":"imprecise","range":60,"type":"scent"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":22},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":20},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":22}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":17},"arcana":{"base":18},"athletics":{"base":23},"diplomacy":{"base":23},"medicine":{"base":21},"religion":{"base":21},"society":{"base":18}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"lg"},"value":["dragon","fire","good","lawful"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.DolNTN9s2p79N8Cy"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"Dp6dq9Jd0TanufdU","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"Q3WxbSH9pxgZ7vKf","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Arcane Prepared Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":6},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"prepared"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{"slot0":{"max":5,"prepared":[{"id":"tZrDUDcvEXVfdEU7"},{"id":"KdXwUzld5GVeaIDc"},{"id":"m9SrkYiapQGTUKNh"},{"id":"OErDJU8btDqt76fn"},{"id":"Ao2WzrkGJEy9tyE6"}]},"slot1":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"wRm53kO6iocinReS"},{"id":"Jrqvcax3K5fX0Qrw"},{"id":"cqSDxwONu6cFGraR"}]},"slot2":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"zyzDPPtESFdFfLlh"},{"id":"iFazaZIit1HI7mna"},{"id":"fWIfRkrIaPy9Wf48"}]},"slot3":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"7cExDSxvxeQob6UG"},{"id":"Clsr1IEEYHet5awC"},{"id":"DGGHbzHrTjycRfbz"}]},"slot4":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"Uq35ow0WeCuBUCPS"},{"id":"teRH4TMsBpFf5UJf"},{"id":"Rn6rxJdPRTlaJdbD"}]},"slot5":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"ntF5zNkb1LH1FR9r"},{"id":"bWGSUkyRdqcehGJ9"},{"id":"5KVJLJTjtclqxioJ"}]},"slot6":{"max":2,"prepared":[{"id":"03nBZZEQ9tyBEEn9"},{"id":"bSLZ7pXYckaOo8Ve"}]}},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":34,"mod":0,"value":27},"tradition":{"value":"arcane"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"ttFxkO2qOIlHaSJc","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Arcane Innate Spells","sort":200000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":33,"mod":0,"value":25},"tradition":{"value":"arcane"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"03nBZZEQ9tyBEEn9","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.dN8QBNuTiaBHCKUe"},"img":"icons/creatures/amphibians/frog-confused-green-blue.webp","name":"Baleful Polymorph","sort":300000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":{"save":{"basic":false,"statistic":"fortitude"}},"description":{"value":"<p>You transform the target creature into a harmless animal appropriate to the area, with effects based on its Fortitude save.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The target's body gains minor features of the harmless animal.

Their brand of evil is organized, manipulative, and regal. Blue dragons often lair near or within cities and set out to bend the population to their will and gather hordes of servants. These dragons love spinning webs of conspiracy. A blue dragon's lackeys typically don't even realize that they serve a dragon, but instead think the protection money, tariffs, or taxes they are amassing is treasure for a cruel but legitimate master. In some ways, blue dragons even see their servants as a living hoard and value them like treasure. These dragons have been known to use these tactics even with their own chromatic cousins.</p>\n<p>Not all blue dragons work clandestinely. Some lord over desert tribes and hill people like vengeful gods, demanding both tribute and worship. No matter how blue dragons manage their underlings, their bearing is regal and their lairs palatial; they're universally intolerant of insubordination, incompetence, and embezzlement, and punish perpetrators with murderous efficiency.</p>\n<p>Blue dragons are also known for their use and mastery of illusion magic. They make use of illusions to augment their manipulations and bewilder their foes in battle. Blue dragons also have some control over water, but use this ability to destroy water, something quite dangerous for those who encounter them in their desert lairs.</p>\n<p>The ideal lair for a blue dragon contains multiple passages, rooms, and secret chambers. As social creatures, blue dragons prefer to host guests in comfort-but their dwellings should not be so public that just anyone can come calling.

Although they typically make their lairs among the highlands, the pursuit of justice leads silver dragons to travel far and wide-often into the very heart of realms overrun by evil. These exemplars of righteousness are ceaseless in their determination to help the weak, spread honor, and stamp out evil.</p>\n<p>Silver dragons are sleek and sinuous. Their hides resemble nothing so much as a suit of gleaming armor, lending further credence to the popular myth that silver dragons are the paladins of dragonkind. The zeal with which they seek out, confront, and defeat evil is unsurpassed even among their metallic cousins, and they adhere to strict codes of honor usually passed down from parent to hatchling. On occasion, they instead learn these codes from trusted mentors, usually other silver dragons or gold dragons. As they age, they become even more dedicated to their codes, often adding new and even more restrictive clauses to the systems that guide their behavior.</p>\n<p>Silver dragons are incredibly altruistic and regularly consort with the citizens of goodly societies, of which they consider themselves protectors and guides. In addition to responding to evil threats, silver dragons work to prevent evil from taking root in the first place, and they ensure mortals under their care are well fed, educated, and treated with dignity. Although silver dragons can seem overzealous or even eager to join the fight against evil, they know that the best way to rid the world of corruption is to stamp out strife and disillusionment at their source, not to passively sit back and watch it grow into an unsolvable problem. Silver dragons can be vindictive, but they can also be forgiving; for evildoers who seek to atone for their sins and turn over a new leaf, the support of a silver dragon is both unwavering and invaluable.</p>\n<p>Many silver dragons are also drawn to religious endeavors, venerating deities such as Iomedae, Sarenrae, and other deities concerned with justice, virtue, and redemption.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals' lives-and of their passing-always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don't seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water-though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other.</p>\n<p>In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts, other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes. Countless other types of dragons are sure to exist, including dragons on far-flung planes of existence and, it is rumored, primeval dragons who soar between the stars.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"fog vision","mod":20,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"},{"acuity":"imprecise","range":60,"type":"scent"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":20},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":17},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":21}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":14},"athletics":{"base":22},"diplomacy":{"base":18},"intimidation":{"base":20},"medicine":{"base":20},"religion":{"base":18},"society":{"base":14}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"lg"},"value":["cold","dragon","good","lawful"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.dYbfZnB1ngiqPm4O"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"ETNlci6VnSthx5V6","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"h2qxWUvI0fbg4RxB","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Divine Innate Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":26,"mod":0,"value":18},"tradition":{"value":"divine"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"fpyaGQ7nPlsCH1nc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.uqlxMQQeSGWEVjki"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/true-seeing.webp","name":"True Seeing (Constant)","sort":200000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":true,"damage":{},"defense":null,"description":{"value":"<p>You see things within 60 feet as they actually are.

They particularly enjoy conversations with humans and other civilized humanoids, delighting in the naive customs of these diminutive races without showing them haughtiness or scorn. While they may seem merely curious, brass dragons engage in this sort of conversation with the goal of keeping up to date on regional politics so they can anticipate future conflicts. Along the way, they create extensive information networks that begin with their own allies but stretch across all levels of humanoid society-networks which the brass dragon then uses to subtly assist settlements near their lair. Unlike the schemes and manipulations of blue dragons, brass dragons use their informant networks to establish justice and equality.</p>\n<p>These carefree dragons value independence and feel that all creatures deserve to live as they please, provided they don't harm others. They are emotional creatures and tend to have short attention spans, sometimes falling victim to depression in their twilight years. To combat this, some brass dragons keep pets and houseplants that they can care for.</p>\n<p>Though they may seem childlike in their curiosity concerning mortal affairs, a brass dragon's prowess in battle is no laughing matter. A brass dragon whose territory or allies are threatened is a terrifying foe indeed, quick to shed their innocent guise and unleash their terrifying might upon evildoers.</p>\n<p>Most brass dragons live in desert climates, and while they keep their lairs hidden, they often build near humanoid settlements.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals' lives-and of their passing-always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don't seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water-though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other. In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts, other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes.

drow priestesses venerate demon lords and other foul divinities.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The first drow were elves who fled into the depths of the world from a devastating cataclysm thousands of years ago. In their journey below, they fell to bickering and in-fighting, drawing the attention of sinister intelligences beyond their own. Whether it was the influence of a specific demon lord, the Rough Beast Rovagug, or some other fell force is unknown, but in that time the elves transformed both spiritually and physically, tainting their hearts with desires for cruelty, sadism, and violence. The hues of their eyes became sinister red or bleached white, and their flesh adopted an unearthly lavender sheen that made the drow instantly recognizable. The drow also developed potent magical abilities and resistances that further empowered them, if at the cost of their souls.</p>\n<p>Over the centuries to follow, the drow developed into a powerful, if violently dysfunctional society, influenced by the worship of demon lords and focused on providing power and glory to a relatively small collection of noble houses. Many of these noble houses are matriarchal in nature and all hold allegiance to a specific demon lord patron-but traditions of worship, warfare, and wizardry help to bind the oft-bickering houses together enough that drow society doesn't simply consume itself from within. Fear of earning the wrath of one's superior-be it a teacher, a parent, a commander, or the demon one worships-is the real bond holding drow society together, and this system is held in esteem by the lowliest drow servant and by the most powerful drow priestess alike.</p>\n<p>The drow are infamous throughout the world, but until recently most assumed stories of demon-worshipping, underground-dwelling elves were spooky legends crafted to share around a campfire. Today, the existence of drow is an understood truth, and while their presence in the dark caverns deep below is unsettling, they seem content to leave the surface world alone for now.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":9,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":8},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":7},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":11}},"skills":{"deception":{"base":8},"intimidation":{"base":8},"religion":{"base":9},"society":{"base":5},"stealth":{"base":7}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"med"},"value":["chaotic","drow","elf","evil","humanoid"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.FaBHkmFGuEIqIYM1"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"fcE9PgnC82e9haL5","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"XsMSamN905Cp8CUb","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Arcane Prepared Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":3},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"prepared"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{"slot0":{"max":5,"prepared":[{"id":"REqK2rtFPmIC9FrI"},{"id":"tEqqvMNATOfUWKfk"},{"id":"ovHc6iwENKBAL49a"},{"id":"4Odj1bmu0busYGrb"},{"id":"S7dTuJDhb0WUCcNj"}]},"slot1":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"J1Fz85uUnj8o2KtZ"},{"id":"z6dLDLnyCyHZlQWQ"},{"id":"BH921E2MW1plWuYr"}]},"slot2":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"8KiQpua6hLk3j6sZ"},{"id":"TgB4csMOOrabsLpD"},{"id":"PQ1pNUszIIgYGKet"}]},"slot3":{"max":2,"prepared":[{"id":"WEClnGcdWnFv6yiY"},{"id":"FJzkNFmyJQEV4GbF"}]}},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":25,"mod":0,"value":18},"tradition":{"value":"arcane"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"6evj7LX0P0Xyv3W8","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Arcane Innate Spells","sort":200000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":25,"mod":0,"value":17},"tradition":{"value":"arcane"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"WEClnGcdWnFv6yiY","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.gPvtmKMRpg9I9D7H"},"img":"icons/magic/earth/barrier-stone-explosion-debris.webp","name":"Earthbind","sort":300000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":{"save":{"basic":false,"statistic":"fortitude"}},"description":{"value":"<p>Using the weight of earth, you hamper a target's flight, with effects based on its Fortitude save.

They particularly enjoy conversations with humans and other civilized humanoids, delighting in the naive customs of these diminutive races without showing them haughtiness or scorn. While they may seem merely curious, brass dragons engage in this sort of conversation with the goal of keeping up to date on regional politics so they can anticipate future conflicts. Along the way, they create extensive information networks that begin with their own allies but stretch across all levels of humanoid society-networks which the brass dragon then uses to subtly assist settlements near their lair. Unlike the schemes and manipulations of blue dragons, brass dragons use their informant networks to establish justice and equality.</p>\n<p>These carefree dragons value independence and feel that all creatures deserve to live as they please, provided they don't harm others. They are emotional creatures and tend to have short attention spans, sometimes falling victim to depression in their twilight years. To combat this, some brass dragons keep pets and houseplants that they can care for.</p>\n<p>Though they may seem childlike in their curiosity concerning mortal affairs, a brass dragon's prowess in battle is no laughing matter. A brass dragon whose territory or allies are threatened is a terrifying foe indeed, quick to shed their innocent guise and unleash their terrifying might upon evildoers.</p>\n<p>Most brass dragons live in desert climates, and while they keep their lairs hidden, they often build near humanoid settlements.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals' lives-and of their passing-always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don't seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water-though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other. In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts, other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes. Countless other types of dragons are sure to exist, including dragons on far-flung planes of existence and, it is rumored, primeval dragons who soar between the stars.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":15,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"},{"acuity":"imprecise","range":60,"type":"scent"},{"acuity":"imprecise","range":30,"type":"tremorsense"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":16},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":15},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":14}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":13},"athletics":{"base":18},"deception":{"base":15},"diplomacy":{"base":15},"society":{"base":14}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"lg"},"value":["chaotic","dragon","fire","good"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.fcE9PgnC82e9haL5"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"fd3Bf10lloqMg2jW","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"b5sQlwDziqEPeMij","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Arcane Prepared Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":4},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"prepared"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{"slot0":{"max":5,"prepared":[{"id":"7XXhNN60rTS6EZgN"},{"id":"ffoGQVOHBghRDviS"},{"id":"Gq5o9cJ8DMAJlgZq"},{"id":"ocidpVSQzYyfAid9"},{"id":"MQWr5uSiQ7PMzKAm"}]},"slot1":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"cwHD2iioKDW87G4n"},{"id":"pkIRpuLjxweAK42N"},{"id":"ubXqGq1UdMxmxXga"}]},"slot2":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"TqnOevCnvsRSZYSy"},{"id":"HYtUNBnoKUotnUx2"},{"id":"2tJGFYVi4G8g9dgB"}]},"slot3":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"1W7LyHdewvQAgSph"},{"id":"Uo9bsWnKBKG9wLN1"},{"id":"MUgK6dTMa0O2CX6I"}]},"slot4":{"max":2,"prepared":[{"id":"od1cWAPkaqLpi3G2"},{"id":"N526ON0uLXdmvgxH"}]}},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":28,"mod":0,"value":21},"tradition":{"value":"arcane"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"ZSlJL6w6J5g6kFBN","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Arcane Innate Spells","sort":200000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":28,"mod":0,"value":20},"tradition":{"value":"arcane"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"od1cWAPkaqLpi3G2","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.VlNcjmYyu95vOUe8"},"img":"icons/magic/symbols/ring-circle-smoke-blue.webp","name":"Dimension Door","sort":300000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":null,"description":{"value":"<p>Opening a door that bypasses normal space, you instantly transport yourself and any items you're wearing and holding from your current space to a clear space within range you can see.

Their brand of evil is organized, manipulative, and regal. Blue dragons often lair near or within cities and set out to bend the population to their will and gather hordes of servants. These dragons love spinning webs of conspiracy. A blue dragon's lackeys typically don't even realize that they serve a dragon, but instead think the protection money, tariffs, or taxes they are amassing is treasure for a cruel but legitimate master. In some ways, blue dragons even see their servants as a living hoard and value them like treasure. These dragons have been known to use these tactics even with their own chromatic cousins.</p>\n<p>Not all blue dragons work clandestinely. Some lord over desert tribes and hill people like vengeful gods, demanding both tribute and worship. No matter how blue dragons manage their underlings, their bearing is regal and their lairs palatial; they're universally intolerant of insubordination, incompetence, and embezzlement, and punish perpetrators with murderous efficiency.</p>\n<p>Blue dragons are also known for their use and mastery of illusion magic. They make use of illusions to augment their manipulations and bewilder their foes in battle. Blue dragons also have some control over water, but use this ability to destroy water, something quite dangerous for those who encounter them in their desert lairs.</p>\n<p>The ideal lair for a blue dragon contains multiple passages, rooms, and secret chambers. As social creatures, blue dragons prefer to host guests in comfort-but their dwellings should not be so public that just anyone can come calling. A force of guards keeps out intruders, and clever illusions conceal the edifice from prying eyes. Rather than a pile of coins or gems, a blue dragon's true hoard is the rich furnishings in its citadel- expensive art, ornate furniture, and architectural marvels.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons.

However, they are naturally scholarly creatures who would rather remain in their lairs studying esoteric lore than go off on a wild adventure. These aloof and stoic dragons also act as preservationists, guarding storehouses of ancient lore from destruction or perversion. Bronze dragons are principled and protective, but while their silver cousins are quick to crusade for justice, bronze dragons prefer to find an important location worthy of their protection and guard it against any attack or unwelcome intrusion.</p>\n<p>Bronze dragons' mastery over water and affinity for electricity means they are a boon to sailors caught in thunderstorms. A bronze dragon's enemies quickly discover neither cloudy sky nor turbulent sea provides shelter from their wrath. Bronze dragons lair along shorelines, often in partially submerged sea caves.</p>\n<p>While all dragons keep hoards of treasure, the hoard of a bronze dragon more resembles a vast library-with the shelves kept carefully above the waterline, of course. In addition to their collections of esoteric lore, bronze dragons keep treasures associated with the sea, such as beautiful scrimshaw, flawless pearls, and equipment inlaid with mother-of-pearl and abalone shell.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals' lives-and of their passing-always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don't seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water-though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other.</p>\n<p>In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts, other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes.

These champions develop a number of talents that make them worthy leaders and potent hunters-namely their abilities to willingly boost the rate of their regeneration and to shake off the acid and fire that would hinder it, not to mention a bestial roar that can send would-be predators scurrying off. Troll kings possess a cunning far beyond their younger kin- they know to keep their allies close, and their enemies even closer. If a troll king so much as suspects that one of its followers is plotting to usurp it, retribution is swift and fatal.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Slavering, cruel, practically invincible brutes: this is the villager's stock description for the dread monsters known as trolls. But words hardly do justice to trolls' capacity for destruction. They are as bloodthirsty as orcs but lacking the discipline, as massive as giants but capable of regenerating wounded flesh in an instant, and as reprobate as ogres but with twice the strength. The only way to really understand the wanton violence of a troll is to experience it firsthand-a fate few would wish even upon their worst enemies.</p>\n<p>The first thing that comes to mind when most think of trolls is the creatures' power of bodily regeneration. So potent is this regeneration that the only way to overcome it is to exploit the troll's vulnerability to acid and fire. It is not enough to slay the troll with caustic or flaming weapons, though-even the smallest scrap of a troll's flesh can regenerate into a full-size troll given enough time. The only sure way to eradicate a troll menace is to burn the monster's entire body until nothing remains.</p>\n<p>Trolls are solitary hunters, for their wickedness is anathema even to other giants. They occasionally roam in small gangs of two to four, but only when prey is plentiful or a particularly strong counterforce has broached their hunting grounds. In rare instances, an old and powerful troll comes to lead small tribes of trolls. Such \"troll kings\" possess enough cunning to lead their hordes in devastating raids and massacres, and their presence permanently alters the surrounding ecosystem. A wide variety of trolls exist, from the terrible monster traditionally associated with the name to the water-dwelling scrag and hybrid flood troll. Regional variations exist as well-mountain trolls among stony peaks, for instance, or moss trolls in swampy bayous-but all share the same trademark regenerative powers and insatiable thirst for blood.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":19,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":23},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":17},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":15}},"skills":{"athletics":{"base":21},"intimidation":{"base":22},"survival":{"base":17}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"lg"},"value":["chaotic","evil","giant","troll"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.FwH05kDUlC8CwWTU"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"Fzn4jHusVeyytgfx","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"rYCzNNJekAP07yuk","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Arcane Innate Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":33,"mod":0,"value":25},"tradition":{"value":"arcane"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"GYywldqipfx3GlUl","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.McnPlLFvKtQVXNcG"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/shape-stone.webp","name":"Shape Stone","sort":200000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":{"save":{"basic":false,"statistic":"reflex"}},"description":{"value":"<p>You shape the stone into a rough shape of your choice.

Copper dragons are hedonists who are quick to indulge in simple pleasures, but they're also sympathetic to other creatures, slow to pass judgment, and careful to always examine a situation from as many perspectives as possible. This philosophy has its drawbacks, however, as copper dragons are susceptible to negative influences and prone to forgiving the less serious evil acts performed by their chromatic cousins and other cruel creatures. Copper dragons also have a difficult time keeping their temper in check once they are roused to anger.</p>\n<p>Copper dragons tend to lair in warm or temperate hills, but due to their nature, they move their lairs every few years. They sometimes live among other people, especially any dwarves who reside nearby. Some copper dragons even worship gods typically worshipped only by humanoids. Among these dragons, worship of Cayden Cailean is most popular, as they see his love of freedom and penchant for alcohol aligning with the typical copper dragon mindset.</p>\n<p>A copper dragon's combat tactics are as unorthodox as its sense of humor, as it is more likely to use mockery and tricks than outright strength to win its battles. As a copper dragon ages, it perfects jokes capable of rendering its foes helpless with laughter.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals' lives-and of their passing-always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don't seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water-though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other.</p>\n<p>In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts, other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes. Countless other types of dragons are sure to exist, including dragons on far-flung planes of existence and, it is rumored, primeval dragons who soar between the stars.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":23,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"},{"acuity":"imprecise","range":60,"type":"scent"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":23},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":22},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":22}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":21},"athletics":{"base":24},"crafting":{"base":22},"deception":{"base":21},"performance":{"base":23},"society":{"base":22},"stealth":{"base":21}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"lg"},"value":["chaotic","dragon","earth","good"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.Fzn4jHusVeyytgfx"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"gDMPUL0UiOHrUUd3","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"bthV65bmBiFxafJ6","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Divine Innate Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":20,"mod":0,"value":12},"tradition":{"value":"divine"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"HPknnMADVjl3vadK","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Champion Devotion Spells","sort":200000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"focus"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":20,"mod":0,"value":12},"tradition":{"value":"divine"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"tRnTQnTcF5F4xbQy","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.zNN9212H2FGfM7VS"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/lay-on-hands.webp","name":"Lay on Hands","sort":300000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":null,"description":{"value":"<p>Your hands become infused with vitality energy, healing a living creature or damaging an undead creature with a touch.</p>\n<p>If you use lay on hands on a willing living target, you restore 6 Hit Points; if the target is one of your allies, they also gain a +2 status bonus to AC for 1 round.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spell-effects.Item.lyLMiauxIVUM3oF1]{Spell Effect: Lay on Hands}</p>\n<p>Against an undead target, you deal 1d6 damage and it must attempt a basic Fortitude save; if it fails, it also takes a -2 status penalty to AC for 1 round.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The amount of healing increases by 6, and the damage to an undead target increases by 1d6.</p>"},"duration":{"sustained":false,"value":""},"level":{"value":1},"location":{"value":"HPknnMADVjl3vadK"},"overlays":{"a33QUFoKgoOprovO":{"name":"Lay on Hands (Vs.

trolls are dim-witted, gangly giants who stalk the fringes of civilization. They rely on their incredible strength to overpower foes with their vicious claws and toothy maws. A troll's endless hunger drives it to consume all variety of living creatures, and it is their ravenous eating habits that fuel trolls' legendary regenerative abilities. Trolls stand anywhere from 12 to 16 feet tall, though they prefer to hunch for comfort and to lull foes into a false sense of security.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Slavering, cruel, practically invincible brutes: this is the villager's stock description for the dread monsters known as trolls. But words hardly do justice to trolls' capacity for destruction. They are as bloodthirsty as orcs but lacking the discipline, as massive as giants but capable of regenerating wounded flesh in an instant, and as reprobate as ogres but with twice the strength. The only way to really understand the wanton violence of a troll is to experience it firsthand-a fate few would wish even upon their worst enemies.</p>\n<p>The first thing that comes to mind when most think of trolls is the creatures' power of bodily regeneration. So potent is this regeneration that the only way to overcome it is to exploit the troll's vulnerability to acid and fire. It is not enough to slay the troll with caustic or flaming weapons, though-even the smallest scrap of a troll's flesh can regenerate into a full-size troll given enough time. The only sure way to eradicate a troll menace is to burn the monster's entire body until nothing remains.</p>\n<p>Trolls are solitary hunters, for their wickedness is anathema even to other giants. They occasionally roam in small gangs of two to four, but only when prey is plentiful or a particularly strong counterforce has broached their hunting grounds. In rare instances, an old and powerful troll comes to lead small tribes of trolls. Such \"troll kings\" possess enough cunning to lead their hordes in devastating raids and massacres, and their presence permanently alters the surrounding ecosystem. A wide variety of trolls exist, from the terrible monster traditionally associated with the name to the water-dwelling scrag and hybrid flood troll. Regional variations exist as well-mountain trolls among stony peaks, for instance, or moss trolls in swampy bayous-but all share the same trademark regenerative powers and insatiable thirst for blood.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":11,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":17},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":11},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":7}},"skills":{"athletics":{"base":12},"intimidation":{"base":12}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"lg"},"value":["chaotic","evil","giant","troll"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.gvCCATlH9mPGWbsp"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"GyigGu36XLPV72nW","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"lL38DigkATyHvflx","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Arcane Innate Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":23,"mod":0,"value":15},"tradition":{"value":"arcane"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"GUFkIF2lbvGvkLj5","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.5bTt2CvYHPvaR7QQ"},"img":"icons/magic/lightning/bolt-strike-explosion-purple.webp","name":"Plane Shift (At Will) (to Astral Plane, Elemental Planes, or Material Plane Only)","sort":200000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":null,"description":{"value":"<p>You and your allies traverse the barriers between planes of existence.

Their cultural militancy enables sea devils to act in concert to perform grand acts of sabotage, marauding, and pillaging, and only the strongest (and most conniving) members of the tribe make it to the top of the social ladder. For all their discipline, however, sea devils are widely known to snap into murderous frenzies at the scent of blood. Even the best-laid plans can fall apart when a sea devil breaks ranks to revel in the spilled blood of their victims, an indulgence that can quickly cause a chain reaction of bloodthirsty ecstasy throughout an entire raiding party.

Sea devils in positions of leadership tend to be among the largest, most violent, and most calculating of their kind, and fully realized sea devils are skilled warriors capable of capturing entire villages on their own. The most powerful sea devils are mighty kings and queens who coordinate the activity of lesser sea devils across territories spanning leagues, foiling attempts at their positions via manufactured blood feuds and wars against their numerous enemies ashore and underwater.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":13,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"},{"acuity":"imprecise","range":30,"type":"wavesense"}]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":16},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":14},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":13}},"skills":{"athletics":{"base":15,"special":[{"base":18,"label":"to Swim","predicate":["action:swim"]}]},"intimidation":{"base":12},"stealth":{"base":12},"survival":{"base":11}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"med"},"value":["amphibious","evil","humanoid","lawful","mutant","sea-devil"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.HFbZ580RDOG6Rxz2"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"hNR4xZRsxUkGPI1v","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"zlPeMmaUBpOYNjEw","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Occult Spontaneous Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":1},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"spontaneous"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{"slot1":{"max":4,"value":4}},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":22,"mod":0,"value":15},"tradition":{"value":"occult"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"iuyu0qM1TjakNK8f","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Occult Innate Spells","sort":200000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":19,"mod":0,"value":11},"tradition":{"value":"occult"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"YkRZtak8W7EsSLNP","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.zvKWclOZ7A53DObE"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/clairvoyance.webp","name":"Clairvoyance","sort":300000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":null,"description":{"value":"<p>You create an @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.zJxUflt9np0q4yML]{Invisible} floating eye at a location within range (even if it's outside your line of sight or line of effect).

Farmers curse the creatures for sucking their livestock dry. It is from such beleaguered people that the bloodseeker's regional name \"stirge,\" possibly a corruption of the word \"scourge,\" comes. Folk wisdom holds that the appearance of bloodseekers in a region signals a healthy herd of livestock, but more often it means bogs or old buildings that haven't been properly tended to. Certainly, no amount of folksy parable can assuage a farmer driven to destitution by a bloodseeker infestation. But despite their role as parasites, bloodseekers aren't hated by all villages. In some cases, the inhabitants of remote backwoods thorps even keep the things as pets or use them as doubtful medicinal \"tools\" to drain away unwanted humors or test for evil spirits possessing the blood. Worshippers of gods of pestilence and parasites often view bloodseekers as sacred to their faith and allow the creatures to feed freely from their bodies. In such societies, those who accidentally give too much are considered to have been \"blessed\" by the village's hungry god.</p>\n<p>Bloodseekers seem to be constantly hungry, but they are not inherently malevolent. They can be scared away fairly easily and prefer to swiftly retreat rather than risk death. Some adventurers report that these creatures can be scared away by waving torches at the flying pests. However, bloodseekers are much bolder when encountered in larger numbers, as bringing down one victim lets an entire colony feed. Bloodseeker colonies are called clots, for obvious and disgusting reasons. If a lone bloodseeker finds a likely victim while its clot is nearby, it emits a high-pitched, keening noise to summon reinforcements.</p>\n<p>Most humanoids avoid bloodseekers, but boggards sometimes cultivate bloodseeker nests around the perimeter of their territory. These colonies serve as a deterrent to intruders, and the boggards sometimes check for bloodseeker prey, collecting the hides or bodies of animals killed by the pests. Meals prepared from slain bloodseekers that have gorged on the blood of specific creatures are a staple among certain boggard communities. The boggards not only eat the actual bloodseekers, but they also make a gelled slurry from the drained blood.</p>\n<p>A typical bloodseeker is about a foot long, with mottled, reddish-brown skin and a yellow underbelly.

Their brand of evil is organized, manipulative, and regal. Blue dragons often lair near or within cities and set out to bend the population to their will and gather hordes of servants. These dragons love spinning webs of conspiracy. A blue dragon's lackeys typically don't even realize that they serve a dragon, but instead think the protection money, tariffs, or taxes they are amassing is treasure for a cruel but legitimate master. In some ways, blue dragons even see their servants as a living hoard and value them like treasure. These dragons have been known to use these tactics even with their own chromatic cousins.</p>\n<p>Not all blue dragons work clandestinely. Some lord over desert tribes and hill people like vengeful gods, demanding both tribute and worship. No matter how blue dragons manage their underlings, their bearing is regal and their lairs palatial; they're universally intolerant of insubordination, incompetence, and embezzlement, and punish perpetrators with murderous efficiency.</p>\n<p>Blue dragons are also known for their use and mastery of illusion magic. They make use of illusions to augment their manipulations and bewilder their foes in battle. Blue dragons also have some control over water, but use this ability to destroy water, something quite dangerous for those who encounter them in their desert lairs.</p>\n<p>The ideal lair for a blue dragon contains multiple passages, rooms, and secret chambers. As social creatures, blue dragons prefer to host guests in comfort-but their dwellings should not be so public that just anyone can come calling. A force of guards keeps out intruders, and clever illusions conceal the edifice from prying eyes. Rather than a pile of coins or gems, a blue dragon's true hoard is the rich furnishings in its citadel- expensive art, ornate furniture, and architectural marvels.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty-be it by claw, tooth, or breath-and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":24,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"},{"acuity":"imprecise","range":60,"type":"scent"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":24},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":23},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":23}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":22},"arcana":{"base":25},"deception":{"base":26},"diplomacy":{"base":26},"intimidation":{"base":24},"society":{"base":23},"stealth":{"base":20},"survival":{"base":22}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"huge"},"value":["dragon","electricity","evil","lawful"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.i3N3udPyTGVPLpoq"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"iF5NeHC6ReqXLFmY","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"QaHD4bOypv7qPbfa","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Occult Innate Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":18,"mod":0,"value":8},"tradition":{"value":"occult"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"JvKzp8uP7vhupytL","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.KqvqNAfGIE5a9wSv"},"img":"icons/magic/life/ankh-gold-blue.webp","name":"Heroism","sort":200000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":null,"description":{"value":"<p>You tap into the target's inner heroism, granting it a +1 status bonus to attack rolls, Perception checks, saving throws, and skill checks.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (6th)</strong> The status bonus increases to +2.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (9th)</strong> The status bonus increases to +3.</p>\n<p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spell-effects.Item.l9HRQggofFGIxEse]{Spell Effect: Heroism}</p>"},"duration":{"sustained":false,"value":"10 minutes"},"level":{"value":3},"location":{"heightenedLevel":3,"value":"QaHD4bOypv7qPbfa"},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Core Rulebook"},"range":{"value":"touch"},"requirements":"","rules":[],"slug":"heroism","target":{"value":"1 creature"},"time":{"value":"2"},"traits":{"rarity":"common","traditions":["divine","occult"],"value":["concentrate","manipulate","mental"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spell","effects":[]},{"_id":"9d2l1nNeedg1KVEr","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.fI20AVwOzJMHXRdo"},"img":"icons/magic/light/projectile-stars-blue.webp","name":"Levitate","sort":300000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":null,"description":{"value":"<p>You defy gravity and levitate the target 5 feet off the ground.

These little constructs are created for a variety of reasons-such as to serve as companions or servants-but their free will means their obedience to their creators is hardly a given. Followers of Pharasma generally abhor soulbound dolls, viewing them as a perversion of the natural cycle of souls, and those who worship the Lady of Graves see the destruction of a soulbound doll, regardless of the construct's alignment, as an important service to the Great Beyond. Soulbound dolls are the simplest in a series of soulbound constructs including human-sized soulbound mannequins, powerful soulbound shells, and sentinel soulbound terra-cotta warriors. Creating them from unwilling living creatures is evil, and an unwilling donor can resist the process with a successful Will save against the creator's Craft DC, ruining the doll if not preventing the donor's death. A non-evil doll can only be crafted from the soul of a person who has given consent to such use before their death occurred</p>\n<p>Soulbound dolls encountered by adventurers are typically guardians of some sort; despite their diminutive size, the soul fragment's power makes the doll's flst more dangerous than a casual observer would expect. Further, it grants the doll a single spell of outsized power given its stature. Because of their autonomy and remarkable intelligence, soulbound dolls are occasionally employed by their crafters as administrators over much more powerful but mindless constructs such as golems, allowing such dolls to control defenses far beyond their own capabilities. Though soulbound dolls contain a small fragment of a soul extracted during or shortly after a person's death, this doesn't affect the deceased's resurrection or progress to the afterlife. This extraction process is lethal to otherwise-living prospective soul donors, though there are rumors of more expensive processes that allows someone to donate a fragment of a living soul without repercussions.</p>\n<p>The soul fragment resides in a soul focus gem typically embedded in the doll's neck or chest. The soul fragment isn't static, and the doll continues to learn from its initial state, meaning its personality and abilities can change, possibly growing closer to the donor's or moving farther afield on its own individual path. The soulbound doll's focus gem retains the doll's memories even after the doll's destruction. The the intact soul focus gem of a destroyed doll can even be placed into a new doll body by someone knowledgeable in the creation of soulbound creatures, effectively reconstituting the soulbound doll.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":8,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":7},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":10},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":6}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":8},"occultism":{"base":4},"stealth":{"base":8}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"tiny"},"value":["construct","good","soulbound"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.iF5NeHC6ReqXLFmY"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"iII08V0HlvWGWSmu","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"QnuvWppYTYaOJTUu","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Divine Innate Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":21,"mod":0,"value":13},"tradition":{"value":"divine"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"PYlSwGscGRdPPJeE","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.SwUiVavHKMWG7t5K"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/tongues.webp","name":"Tongues (Constant)","sort":200000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":null,"description":{"value":"<p>The target can understand all words regardless of language and also speak the languages of other creatures.

Because they roam the wilds of Nirvana and Elysium, horned archons are among the best at understanding the perspectives of other celestials.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Archons are guardians of Heaven and enemies of chaos and evil. They openly fight back the spread of fiends but also quietly nurture the seeds of virtue within mortals, teaching the denizens of the Material Plane how to act with honor and integrity, enact just laws, and cast off sin and temptation.</p>\n<p>Archons live in the immense seven-tiered mountain of Heaven. They manifest in the Garden at the mountain's peak from mortal souls who answer a mysterious voice. There they swear to forever serve the cause of justice and transform into their new archon forms. Intensely orderly in their metamorphosis, new archons begin as lantern archons or other lesser forms, transforming into ever-greater archons as their virtue and achievements grow. Each archon represents a particular virtue, such as hope, charity, justice, or courage, and they gain strength in the presence of mortals who exemplify this virtue. Due to their extremely lawful nature, archons sometimes find themselves at odds with azatas.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":11,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":11},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":10},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":11}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":12},"nature":{"base":11},"religion":{"base":9},"stealth":{"base":10},"survival":{"base":11,"special":[{"base":15,"label":"to Track","predicate":["action:track"]}]}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"med"},"value":["archon","celestial","good","holy","lawful"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.iII08V0HlvWGWSmu"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"IMasNR02C74jy3cT","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"vknZjhozz53haMJZ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Arcane Innate Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":33,"mod":0,"value":25},"tradition":{"value":"arcane"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"QlnqT9co3HINOMCw","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.9XHmC2JgTUIQ1CCm"},"img":"icons/magic/air/fog-gas-smoke-dense-white.webp","name":"Obscuring Mist (At Will)","sort":200000,"system":{"area":{"type":"burst","value":20},"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":null,"description":{"value":"<p>You call forth a cloud of mist.

However, they are naturally scholarly creatures who would rather remain in their lairs studying esoteric lore than go off on a wild adventure. These aloof and stoic dragons also act as preservationists, guarding storehouses of ancient lore from destruction or perversion. Bronze dragons are principled and protective, but while their silver cousins are quick to crusade for justice, bronze dragons prefer to find an important location worthy of their protection and guard it against any attack or unwelcome intrusion.</p>\n<p>Bronze dragons' mastery over water and affinity for electricity means they are a boon to sailors caught in thunderstorms.

Bronze dragons lair along shorelines, often in partially submerged sea caves.</p>\n<p>While all dragons keep hoards of treasure, the hoard of a bronze dragon more resembles a vast library-with the shelves kept carefully above the waterline, of course. In addition to their collections of esoteric lore, bronze dragons keep treasures associated with the sea, such as beautiful scrimshaw, flawless pearls, and equipment inlaid with mother-of-pearl and abalone shell.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty.

Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don't seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water-though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other.</p>\n<p>In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts, other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes.

These little constructs are created for a variety of reasons-such as to serve as companions or servants-but their free will means their obedience to their creators is hardly a given. Followers of Pharasma generally abhor soulbound dolls, viewing them as a perversion of the natural cycle of souls, and those who worship the Lady of Graves see the destruction of a soulbound doll, regardless of the construct's alignment, as an important service to the Great Beyond. Soulbound dolls are the simplest in a series of soulbound constructs including human-sized soulbound mannequins, powerful soulbound shells, and sentinel soulbound terra-cotta warriors. Creating them from unwilling living creatures is evil, and an unwilling donor can resist the process with a successful Will save against the creator's Craft DC, ruining the doll if not preventing the donor's death. A non-evil doll can only be crafted from the soul of a person who has given consent to such use before their death occurred</p>\n<p>Soulbound dolls encountered by adventurers are typically guardians of some sort; despite their diminutive size, the soul fragment's power makes the doll's flst more dangerous than a casual observer would expect. Further, it grants the doll a single spell of outsized power given its stature. Because of their autonomy and remarkable intelligence, soulbound dolls are occasionally employed by their crafters as administrators over much more powerful but mindless constructs such as golems, allowing such dolls to control defenses far beyond their own capabilities. Though soulbound dolls contain a small fragment of a soul extracted during or shortly after a person's death, this doesn't affect the deceased's resurrection or progress to the afterlife. This extraction process is lethal to otherwise-living prospective soul donors, though there are rumors of more expensive processes that allows someone to donate a fragment of a living soul without repercussions.</p>\n<p>The soul fragment resides in a soul focus gem typically embedded in the doll's neck or chest. The soul fragment isn't static, and the doll continues to learn from its initial state, meaning its personality and abilities can change, possibly growing closer to the donor's or moving farther afield on its own individual path. The soulbound doll's focus gem retains the doll's memories even after the doll's destruction. The the intact soul focus gem of a destroyed doll can even be placed into a new doll body by someone knowledgeable in the creation of soulbound creatures, effectively reconstituting the soulbound doll.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":8,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":7},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":10},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":6}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":8},"occultism":{"base":4},"stealth":{"base":8}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"tiny"},"value":["chaotic","construct","good","soulbound"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.j0gCguJx3ILB1j9o"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"j1mm6bb3hZ56jSrK","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"eIFUAYDyIaHqOP6A","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Primal Innate Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":18,"mod":0,"value":10},"tradition":{"value":"primal"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"JYwinwlgA0ff0yZ9","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.0qaqksrGGDj74HXE"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/glitterdust.webp","name":"Glitterdust","sort":200000,"system":{"area":{"type":"burst","value":10},"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":{"save":{"basic":false,"statistic":"reflex"}},"description":{"value":"<p>Creatures in the area are outlined by glittering dust.

largest and most powerful of the chromatic dragons, red dragons are a menace to civilizations everywhere, and their strength is rivaled only by their arrogance. Red dragons see themselves as regents and overlords of all dragonkind. With their crowns of crimson spikes and their command of blistering frame, this is no haughty boast in their eyes-only unquestioned fact.</p>\n<p>Red dragons don't deign to speak with lesser creatures; they simply dominate and burn, enslaving weaker creatures to act as servants and to look after their lairs while the dragons slumber away. They take pleasure in dominating these creatures, and they demand tribute from their supplicants. Those who anger or disappoint end up eaten or reduced to ash. They command their enslaved minions to constantly build onto their lairs, carving out new tunnels and designing cunning traps that ensure the dragon's security.</p>\n<p>Driven by their arrogance, red dragons are the most likely of the chromatic dragons to ravage settlements. They want the world to see them in their rightful place as powerful tyrants, and they delight in threatening all other creatures. They have no qualms about bullying, manipulating, or killing to complete their goals-or simply intimidating others through a public display of brutality and dominance.</p>\n<p>As legendary as the brutishness of red dragons is the magnificence of their hoards of gold. Their lairs are often situated in dangerous places, with volcanoes being a favorite spot, as they find them foreboding and the constant warmth is comfortable. No matter the locale, red dragons sleep on a litter of coins and other treasures, which they zealously guard. Sometimes, the dragon's internal heat causes these precious metals to fuse together.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty-be it by claw, tooth, or breath-and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"smoke vision","mod":26,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"},{"acuity":"imprecise","range":60,"type":"scent"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":28},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":25},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":26}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":23},"arcana":{"base":25},"athletics":{"base":29},"deception":{"base":25},"diplomacy":{"base":25},"intimidation":{"base":27},"stealth":{"base":23}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"huge"},"value":["chaotic","dragon","evil","fire"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.JhQGNMlKARMx1n2D"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"JiThbhDfjUoPaTP1","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"SnCGhLws82aS8xpS","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Jaws","sort":100000,"system":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"custom":"","value":["improved-grab"]},"bonus":{"value":38},"damageRolls":{"z1j1bg9xqxgtst8fgag3":{"damage":"4d12+18","damageType":"piercing"}},"description":{"value":""},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["reach-20","unarmed"]},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"melee","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"SmRyQEGPbRIR82tT","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Tsunami Jet","sort":200000,"system":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"custom":"","value":["push"]},"bonus":{"value":38},"damageRolls":{"s31a8tl9q4asg6vl811j":{"damage":"4d10+18","damageType":"bludgeoning"}},"description":{"value":""},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["brutal","range-500"]},"weaponType":{"value":"ranged"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"melee","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"v2Vcuxvy5icZyHkj","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Item.9qV49KjZujZnSp6w"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"All-Around Vision","sort":300000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"defensive","description":{"value":"<p>@Localize[PF2E.NPC.Abilities.Glossary.AllAroundVision]</p>"},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"},"rules":[{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"override","path":"system.attributes.flanking.flankable","value":false}],"slug":"all-around-vision","traits":{"rarity":"common","value":[]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"action","effects":[]},{"_id":"XxKXmsn4wSfWyyXp","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Item.hFtNbo1LKYCoDy2O"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Reaction.webp","name":"Attack of Opportunity","sort":400000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"reaction"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"defensive","description":{"value":"<p>@Localize[PF2E.NPC.Abilities.Glossary.AttackOfOpportunity]</p>"},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"},"rules":[],"slug":"attack-of-opportunity","traits":{"rarity":"common","value":[]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"action","effects":[]},{"_id":"LZ3htI7JRHvcwAhU","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Double Opportunity","sort":500000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"defensive","description":{"value":"<p>A baomal gains an extra reaction each round that it can use only to make an Attack of Opportunity.

The key to understanding green dragons is to understand their obsession with knowledge and self-discipline. Any careful approach that takes advantage of a green dragon's fixations may end in a diplomatic outcome, but any misstep or slight can provoke a savage attack. Like most chromatic dragons, green dragons do not suffer fools-and the threshold for what they consider foolish is very low.</p>\n<p>Though more open than their chromatic cousins to dealing with other creatures and dragons, green dragons prefer an isolated and quiet life. They tend to lair in the most forbidding parts of a forest, surrounded by tangled thickets, or else at the heart of some dismal gulch. If the terrain is suitable, some green dragons make their home in natural caves, which they expand to suit their needs.</p>\n<p>Green dragons' pride leads them to see to the preservation of their forest homes. They feel that a verdant and lush forest is something that they alone have cultivated. This leads some green dragons to follow the path of druidism, though most prefer to study the arcane arts and occult lore. Most of them delve deeply into one particular field of study, and correspond with other scholars in the field by adopting a pen name that hides their true nature. Regardless of their chosen focus, green dragons seek to improve themselves, and their desire for knowledge makes them more likely to deal diplomatically with other creatures in order to obtain new information.</p>\n<p>Their hoards are typically well kept, organized, and filled with tomes of lore and scrolls of magic along with antiquities they collect for their own inscrutable reasons. Many of these treasures come from across the globe, and many an adventurer has survived an encounter with a green dragon by stroking its ego and plying it with rare artifacts or lost lore from ancient cultures.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty-be it by claw, tooth, or breath-and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":22,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"},{"acuity":"imprecise","range":60,"type":"scent"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":20},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":22},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":23}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":19},"arcana":{"base":22},"athletics":{"base":24},"deception":{"base":19},"diplomacy":{"base":23},"intimidation":{"base":23},"nature":{"base":20},"occultism":{"base":24},"society":{"base":22},"stealth":{"base":21}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"huge"},"value":["amphibious","dragon","evil","lawful"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.JKG3m8pFISF48Sfr"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"jlEFaUJjAK4MTsLc","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"omXkYKF6c76YYVUV","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Divine Prepared Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":8},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"prepared"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{"slot0":{"max":5,"prepared":[{"id":"9otHcksijcCEAOuu"},{"id":"f0H3hX5rH6cTyXKp"},{"id":"4dYUwguS4fxRX0Ru"},{"id":"mEqJPUPWzMrlPXC1"},{"id":"ZzcWPxZzA3DYf9hx"}]},"slot1":{"max":4,"prepared":[{"id":"HYhgRIWrK6CFG7jQ"},{"id":"UKFHBI94XgnsTCvF"},{"id":"z1UcouE5sbjB0SbW"},{"id":"uQrDbYf8lr43G2sO"}]},"slot2":{"max":4,"prepared":[{"id":"gxIOvyTGAnM1Qz8r"},{"id":"8CZLsRmRnYmJxhdE"},{"id":"l0uVTOF85qMRW5MG"},{"id":"xI8rC1uNOMe4kguw"}]},"slot3":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"98Y6J6id8FBKOj0v"},{"id":"gBgCpXmjD47fRdEx"},{"id":"CJCHj39KOOSPUl7Z"}]},"slot4":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"1eHTRUpp6FXCogv8"},{"id":"VRhMcwCAjhOfvfZO"},{"id":"l0uVTOF85qMRW5MG"}]},"slot5":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"qX98rPfhDuRdfGl7"},{"id":"98Y6J6id8FBKOj0v"},{"id":"qG6Ql29OMhI6fvCJ"}]},"slot6":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"bjOvkckZAHENCrif"},{"id":"w5ulCSg3geaoa4cb"},{"id":"q1un4FMJvSYFWrrU"}]},"slot7":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"OxUaXagY0qiuP31V"},{"id":"1pN7od9WApkf06H8"},{"id":"qlpBKK9d7lAO9vRL"}]},"slot8":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"3xCo4s2brHouEV3q"},{"id":"OxUaXagY0qiuP31V"},{"id":"98Y6J6id8FBKOj0v"}]}},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":40,"mod":0,"value":36},"tradition":{"value":"divine"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"siaZvbqZwz1jMZvH","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Arcane Innate Spells","sort":200000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":40,"mod":0,"value":32},"tradition":{"value":"arcane"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"3xCo4s2brHouEV3q","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.CeSh8QcVnqP5OlLj"},"img":"icons/environment/settlement/watchtower-cliff.webp","name":"Discern Location","sort":300000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":null,"description":{"value":"<p>You learn the name of the target's exact location (including the building, community, and country) and plane of existence.

Although they typically make their lairs among the highlands, the pursuit of justice leads silver dragons to travel far and wide-often into the very heart of realms overrun by evil. These exemplars of righteousness are ceaseless in their determination to help the weak, spread honor, and stamp out evil.</p>\n<p>Silver dragons are sleek and sinuous. Their hides resemble nothing so much as a suit of gleaming armor, lending further credence to the popular myth that silver dragons are the paladins of dragonkind. The zeal with which they seek out, confront, and defeat evil is unsurpassed even among their metallic cousins, and they adhere to strict codes of honor usually passed down from parent to hatchling. On occasion, they instead learn these codes from trusted mentors, usually other silver dragons or gold dragons. As they age, they become even more dedicated to their codes, often adding new and even more restrictive clauses to the systems that guide their behavior.</p>\n<p>Silver dragons are incredibly altruistic and regularly consort with the citizens of goodly societies, of which they consider themselves protectors and guides. In addition to responding to evil threats, silver dragons work to prevent evil from taking root in the first place, and they ensure mortals under their care are well fed, educated, and treated with dignity. Although silver dragons can seem overzealous or even eager to join the fight against evil, they know that the best way to rid the world of corruption is to stamp out strife and disillusionment at their source, not to passively sit back and watch it grow into an unsolvable problem. Silver dragons can be vindictive, but they can also be forgiving; for evildoers who seek to atone for their sins and turn over a new leaf, the support of a silver dragon is both unwavering and invaluable.</p>\n<p>Many silver dragons are also drawn to religious endeavors, venerating deities such as Iomedae, Sarenrae, and other deities concerned with justice, virtue, and redemption.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals' lives-and of their passing-always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don't seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water-though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other.</p>\n<p>In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts, other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse.

They particularly enjoy conversations with humans and other civilized humanoids, delighting in the naive customs of these diminutive races without showing them haughtiness or scorn. While they may seem merely curious, brass dragons engage in this sort of conversation with the goal of keeping up to date on regional politics so they can anticipate future conflicts. Along the way, they create extensive information networks that begin with their own allies but stretch across all levels of humanoid society-networks which the brass dragon then uses to subtly assist settlements near their lair. Unlike the schemes and manipulations of blue dragons, brass dragons use their informant networks to establish justice and equality.</p>\n<p>These carefree dragons value independence and feel that all creatures deserve to live as they please, provided they don't harm others. They are emotional creatures and tend to have short attention spans, sometimes falling victim to depression in their twilight years. To combat this, some brass dragons keep pets and houseplants that they can care for.</p>\n<p>Though they may seem childlike in their curiosity concerning mortal affairs, a brass dragon's prowess in battle is no laughing matter. A brass dragon whose territory or allies are threatened is a terrifying foe indeed, quick to shed their innocent guise and unleash their terrifying might upon evildoers.</p>\n<p>Most brass dragons live in desert climates, and while they keep their lairs hidden, they often build near humanoid settlements.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty.

After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water-though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other. In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts, other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse.

They particularly enjoy conversations with humans and other civilized humanoids, delighting in the naive customs of these diminutive races without showing them haughtiness or scorn. While they may seem merely curious, brass dragons engage in this sort of conversation with the goal of keeping up to date on regional politics so they can anticipate future conflicts. Along the way, they create extensive information networks that begin with their own allies but stretch across all levels of humanoid society-networks which the brass dragon then uses to subtly assist settlements near their lair. Unlike the schemes and manipulations of blue dragons, brass dragons use their informant networks to establish justice and equality.</p>\n<p>These carefree dragons value independence and feel that all creatures deserve to live as they please, provided they don't harm others. They are emotional creatures and tend to have short attention spans, sometimes falling victim to depression in their twilight years. To combat this, some brass dragons keep pets and houseplants that they can care for.</p>\n<p>Though they may seem childlike in their curiosity concerning mortal affairs, a brass dragon's prowess in battle is no laughing matter. A brass dragon whose territory or allies are threatened is a terrifying foe indeed, quick to shed their innocent guise and unleash their terrifying might upon evildoers.</p>\n<p>Most brass dragons live in desert climates, and while they keep their lairs hidden, they often build near humanoid settlements.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals' lives-and of their passing-always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don't seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water-though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other. In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts, other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes. Countless other types of dragons are sure to exist, including dragons on far-flung planes of existence and, it is rumored, primeval dragons who soar between the stars.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":30,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"},{"acuity":"imprecise","range":60,"type":"scent"},{"acuity":"imprecise","range":60,"type":"tremorsense"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":30},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":29},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":30}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":27},"athletics":{"base":31},"deception":{"base":27},"diplomacy":{"base":29},"society":{"base":28}},"traits":{"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"huge"},"value":["chaotic","dragon","fire","good"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.kbZ3t5HhHRJJ4AMn"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"kCRfBZqCugMQmdpd","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"O01HSm8iaUsEoGok","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Arcane Spontaneous Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"spontaneous"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{"slot1":{"max":4,"value":4}},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":20,"mod":0,"value":12},"tradition":{"value":"arcane"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"laJspBpdfBwzH2g9","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.gpzpAAAJ1Lza2JVl"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/detect-magic.webp","name":"Detect Magic","sort":200000,"system":{"area":{"type":"emanation","value":30},"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":null,"description":{"value":"<p>You send out a pulse that registers the presence of magic.

They attack from the darkness and at range, and kobold artificers and engineers master the art of simple but effective traps, which they use to protect their lairs.

Dragons in particular are viewed with a deferential awe, and kobolds eagerly offer their services to such mighty and glorious creatures when they can.

Crafting an adamantine golem requires a quantity of adamantine so massive that collecting it usually requires mounting a mining expedition to a distant planet, the Plane of Earth, or an Outer Plane.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Crafted of base materials and then magically animated into a powerful guardian, the legendary golem is a living construct that mindlessly obeys its creator's commands-often continuing to do so for years or even centuries after its creator's death. There exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure vitality energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem's unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons.</p>\n<p>Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures.

are legendary hunters and trackers who resemble heavily muscled humans with the bodies of powerful horses from the waist down. They are typically reclusive but haughty, quick to assume that their handsome physiques and long history of cultural traditions make them superior to any two-legged folk they encounter. While stories of bloody clashes between centaurs and humanoid settlers are well known, centaurs are neither intrinsically bloodthirsty nor recklessly aggressive. Rather, they are proud and stubborn and do not take kindly to outsiders who encroach on their ancestral grounds, some of which have been ruled by centaurs for thousands of years. Against despoilers of nature who fail to heed their warnings, centaurs do not hesitate to use their finely honed hunting skills to inflict deadly wounds.</p>\n<p>Centaurs train with weapons as well as their heavy hooves, and the thunder of centaurs charging across the plains is often mistaken for a stampede or even an earthquake. Despite their insular nature, some centaurs form close alliances with elves, fey, gnomes, and isolated human communities. Such allies are often surprised to learn the depths of centaurs' honor, pragmatism, and wilderness lore. Rarely, a centaur leaves its tribe to travel the wider world. Such lone centaur wanderers more easily integrate into humanoid societies, but other centaurs are quick to assume that some dishonor led to their exile and thus give such vagabonds a wide berth.</p>\n<p>Centaurs have incredible variation in their individual size and coloration. Their upper bodies are fairly similar within a tribe and even region, but their lower bodies-like those of horses-can vary widely from parent to child. Most centaurs are at least 7 feet tall and weigh more than 2,000 pounds.</p>\n<p>Centaurs live in groups of dozens of members, usually led by an old, powerful seer or battle-hardened warrior who has carried out many noble deeds and earned a lifetime of respect from their comrades. The revered leader guides the habits of their entire group; a wise seer might encourage the tribe to roam far from civilization to preserve the ways of its ancestors, while an aggressive warrior might foster skirmishes with nearby humanoid settlements and even rival centaur groups.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder

Nearly all other dragons look down on white dragons as hopelessly hotheaded and dull, though this does not make them any less dangerous-in fact, it may mean the opposite. It's nearly impossible to treat with white dragons, not because they lack the capacity to do so, but because they just don't care to. They are as difficult to deal with as they are quick to anger, and they become incensed at almost anything. When a white dragon does speak, it spews threats, inane jokes, and incoherent babbling as a prelude to attacking-and when the attack comes, it's bloody and relentless.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, white dragons prefer very cold, remote locations that are far from people. Dwelling on glacial mountaintops or in ice caverns beneath forbidding tundra, they treat the lands around them as their own personal hunting grounds. They fly out to feed or terrorize other creatures, especially those who trespass near the dragon's territory, then bring any treasure back to be displayed in icy niches in their lairs. They collect all kinds of valuables, with a slight preference for items with high utility-such as tools, trade goods, and fine food-over coins or jewels. The ability to shape ice lets white dragons rearrange their lairs exactly to their specifications, and they take great pride in how they've decorated their homes over the years.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons.

However, they are naturally scholarly creatures who would rather remain in their lairs studying esoteric lore than go off on a wild adventure. These aloof and stoic dragons also act as preservationists, guarding storehouses of ancient lore from destruction or perversion. Bronze dragons are principled and protective, but while their silver cousins are quick to crusade for justice, bronze dragons prefer to find an important location worthy of their protection and guard it against any attack or unwelcome intrusion.</p>\n<p>Bronze dragons' mastery over water and affinity for electricity means they are a boon to sailors caught in thunderstorms. A bronze dragon's enemies quickly discover neither cloudy sky nor turbulent sea provides shelter from their wrath. Bronze dragons lair along shorelines, often in partially submerged sea caves.</p>\n<p>While all dragons keep hoards of treasure, the hoard of a bronze dragon more resembles a vast library-with the shelves kept carefully above the waterline, of course. In addition to their collections of esoteric lore, bronze dragons keep treasures associated with the sea, such as beautiful scrimshaw, flawless pearls, and equipment inlaid with mother-of-pearl and abalone shell.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals' lives-and of their passing-always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don't seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water-though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other.</p>\n<p>In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts, other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes.

Nearly all other dragons look down on white dragons as hopelessly hotheaded and dull, though this does not make them any less dangerous-in fact, it may mean the opposite. It's nearly impossible to treat with white dragons, not because they lack the capacity to do so, but because they just don't care to. They are as difficult to deal with as they are quick to anger, and they become incensed at almost anything. When a white dragon does speak, it spews threats, inane jokes, and incoherent babbling as a prelude to attacking-and when the attack comes, it's bloody and relentless.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, white dragons prefer very cold, remote locations that are far from people. Dwelling on glacial mountaintops or in ice caverns beneath forbidding tundra, they treat the lands around them as their own personal hunting grounds. They fly out to feed or terrorize other creatures, especially those who trespass near the dragon's territory, then bring any treasure back to be displayed in icy niches in their lairs. They collect all kinds of valuables, with a slight preference for items with high utility-such as tools, trade goods, and fine food-over coins or jewels. The ability to shape ice lets white dragons rearrange their lairs exactly to their specifications, and they take great pride in how they've decorated their homes over the years.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons.

They command the unwavering reverence of all other metallic dragons, who view gold dragons as their leaders and counselors. Golds rival the raw power of even red dragons, much to the chagrin of their chromatic cousins, and the two races are often regarded as bitter rivals. But despite their incredible power, gold dragons are fond of discourse and prefer to talk through solutions to problems rather than rely upon brute strength. Long-lived as they are, they necessarily take a wide view of all situations and never act without considering all possible options and outcomes. Because of this, gold dragons willingly converse with any creature that seeks them out, even evil chromatic dragons. Mortals might find this behavior strange, considering the long-standing war between chromatic and metallic dragons, but dragons know all too well that desperate situations sometimes call for drastic alliances. And although gold dragons might consider brief truces with their chromatic brethren in the case of world-ending threats, they also know when such alliances have run their course.</p>\n<p>When another metallic dragon faces a quandary or a foe beyond its own ability to overcome, its best option is often to seek the counsel of the eternally wise and gloriously righteous gold dragons. Locating these legendary beings is no easy task, however, for gold dragons are notoriously reclusive. Their intellect and wisdom is such that they prefer to ponder the great questions of life in seclusion, where they strive to formulate solutions to the world's most pressing problems. As a result, gold dragons are sometimes absent when metallic dragons gather together, or are missing from tribunals where their counsel would be beneficial. Impatient dragons sometimes begrudge gold dragons for this apparent unreliability, but such aspersions are usually a result of jealousy rather than any true criticism; in their hearts, other dragons know that few gold dragons purposefully exclude themselves from truly important matters.</p>\n<p>A gold dragon's incredible foresight and unparalleled enlightenment means they are unlikely to interfere in the business of individual mortals, though the rare person who captures the attention of a gold dragon is fortunate indeed, for there are few beings in the cosmos who can offer such prudent and considerate advice. Rulers and individuals in stations of high power have an easier time of garnering the aid of a gold dragon; entire wars have been avoided thanks to a gold dragon's last-minute intermediation.</p>\n<p>Gold dragons are often found in warm grasslands and savannas, lands where they can enjoy long, meditative flights without attracting the attention of potential enemies. They tend to sleep either out in the open in a barren, remote place, or within a heavily secreted or fortified lair, such as a forgotten sink hole or in the labyrinthine caverns of a terrestrial chasm. Gold dragons may enlist trusted servants and allies to guard their lairs, though many live truly solitary lives, preferring to protect their hoards with nonlethal traps and magical wards.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals' lives-and of their passing-always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don't seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water-though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other. In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts, other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes. Countless other types of dragons are sure to exist, including dragons on far-flung planes of existence and, it is rumored, primeval dragons who soar between the stars.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder

or in the war-torn regions surrounding besieged cities, wemmuths are vile swaths of vines that draw sustenance from mortal suffering, lapping up blood like water. Possessing a rudimentary intelligence and an unquenchable thirst for blood, wemmuths lie in wait for most of their lives, growing to incredible size in the bloody soil of their grisly homes. Though the vines that comprise a wemmuth's body are scarcely thicker than rope, a single adult wemmuth system consists of 6 tons of vines, enough to stretch for 6,000 feet if stretched from end to end in a single straight line. Wemmuths never orient themselves this way, however, instead preferring to wrap themselves into massive mounds approximately 15 feet across and equally thick. Although wemmuths are often spotted lazing about, the scent of blood is enough to whip one into a violent frenzy. The creature condenses its entire mass into a sphere of sharp thorns and lashing vines, resembling a hateful tumbleweed the size of an elephant. Wemmuths commonly dig up massive boulders or entire trees from the ground and incorporate them into their rolling mass, using these objects to bolster their defense against many forms of attack or hurling them at faraway foes with terrifying precision.</p>\n<p>Some speculate that wemmuths are a form of diabolical corruption let loose upon Golarion by House Thrune of Cheliax, perhaps as a scorched earth tactic against their rivals. Influential nobles from Nirmathas and Molthune both point fingers at one another for the wemmuth's creation, Nirmathas citing Molthune's close ties to Infernal Cheliax and Molthune blaming the primal magic commonly employed by Nirmathas's many druids and rangers. Several Varisian tales describe creatures closely matching the wemmuth's description attempting to apprehend a famous folk trickster, while crusaders from Mendev adhere to the belief that the wemmuths were a blight unleashed upon Golarion by Deskari, former demon lord of locusts, before his defeat at the hands of mortal heroes.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":25,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"},{"acuity":"imprecise","range":60,"type":"tremorsense"}]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":27},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":27},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":24}},"skills":{"athletics":{"base":30},"deception":{"base":28},"stealth":{"base":30},"survival":{"base":27}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"huge"},"value":["evil","plant"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.NTXm3ee7WZJ92Sww"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"NW1Ax1QGE9W4DmiN","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"q09mldN5OwQ33WsU","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Divine Innate Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":23,"mod":0,"value":15},"tradition":{"value":"divine"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"o5Zxivy6gPz9uwu3","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.VlNcjmYyu95vOUe8"},"img":"icons/magic/symbols/ring-circle-smoke-blue.webp","name":"Dimension Door (At Will)","sort":200000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":null,"description":{"value":"<p>Opening a door that bypasses normal space, you instantly transport yourself and any items you're wearing and holding from your current space to a clear space within range you can see.

They command the unwavering reverence of all other metallic dragons, who view gold dragons as their leaders and counselors. Golds rival the raw power of even red dragons, much to the chagrin of their chromatic cousins, and the two races are often regarded as bitter rivals. But despite their incredible power, gold dragons are fond of discourse and prefer to talk through solutions to problems rather than rely upon brute strength. Long-lived as they are, they necessarily take a wide view of all situations and never act without considering all possible options and outcomes. Because of this, gold dragons willingly converse with any creature that seeks them out, even evil chromatic dragons. Mortals might find this behavior strange, considering the long-standing war between chromatic and metallic dragons, but dragons know all too well that desperate situations sometimes call for drastic alliances. And although gold dragons might consider brief truces with their chromatic brethren in the case of world-ending threats, they also know when such alliances have run their course.</p>\n<p>When another metallic dragon faces a quandary or a foe beyond its own ability to overcome, its best option is often to seek the counsel of the eternally wise and gloriously righteous gold dragons. Locating these legendary beings is no easy task, however, for gold dragons are notoriously reclusive. Their intellect and wisdom is such that they prefer to ponder the great questions of life in seclusion, where they strive to formulate solutions to the world's most pressing problems. As a result, gold dragons are sometimes absent when metallic dragons gather together, or are missing from tribunals where their counsel would be beneficial. Impatient dragons sometimes begrudge gold dragons for this apparent unreliability, but such aspersions are usually a result of jealousy rather than any true criticism; in their hearts, other dragons know that few gold dragons purposefully exclude themselves from truly important matters.</p>\n<p>A gold dragon's incredible foresight and unparalleled enlightenment means they are unlikely to interfere in the business of individual mortals, though the rare person who captures the attention of a gold dragon is fortunate indeed, for there are few beings in the cosmos who can offer such prudent and considerate advice. Rulers and individuals in stations of high power have an easier time of garnering the aid of a gold dragon; entire wars have been avoided thanks to a gold dragon's last-minute intermediation.</p>\n<p>Gold dragons are often found in warm grasslands and savannas, lands where they can enjoy long, meditative flights without attracting the attention of potential enemies. They tend to sleep either out in the open in a barren, remote place, or within a heavily secreted or fortified lair, such as a forgotten sink hole or in the labyrinthine caverns of a terrestrial chasm. Gold dragons may enlist trusted servants and allies to guard their lairs, though many live truly solitary lives, preferring to protect their hoards with nonlethal traps and magical wards.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals' lives-and of their passing-always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don't seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water-though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other. In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts, other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes. Countless other types of dragons are sure to exist, including dragons on far-flung planes of existence and, it is rumored, primeval dragons who soar between the stars.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":36,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"},{"acuity":"imprecise","range":80,"type":"scent"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":37},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":34},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":39}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":29},"arcana":{"base":31},"athletics":{"base":35},"diplomacy":{"base":35},"medicine":{"base":36},"religion":{"base":36},"society":{"base":35}},"traits":{"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"grg"},"value":["dragon","fire","good","lawful"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.nWiibOE9wVSlTdkx"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"oj0vzfjflUc3xMBo","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"zwfFiuZdh5gkdUpi","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Arcane Prepared Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":6},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"prepared"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{"slot0":{"max":5,"prepared":[{"id":"ZU0JoJWhOlwVhAw4"},{"id":"4DWkpZ02zlKcWfmP"},{"id":"3GxceZAekxv9fKLE"},{"id":"5FBe2PW6ZVZ4kHNV"},{"id":"2tsNwRnjVRI9rn00"}]},"slot1":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"ZJiU6LeLH21BlL6D"},{"id":"s8F2XR3lv7wMr4H7"},{"id":"0T8PWa7oL4GGZqmL"}]},"slot2":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"aN5rFuULEOYJj5TR"},{"id":"ONljWtfzpls0XdPz"},{"id":"vcurBySQPcKuuJoD"}]},"slot3":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"00wLUge6JfTEm2ZY"},{"id":"A4VeHFaXam1zSym5"},{"id":"RJkqUsQy0yc7oIeb"}]},"slot4":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"woevPN949SG7l2Pl"},{"id":"1ldrttlgBbthdx4L"},{"id":"AptfgSRsxcGbyD7a"}]},"slot5":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"nFZ14OlOQP5lPslu"},{"id":"3CQHKlG3GuJg2NWE"},{"id":"KGw3wQSZs9dpMJC9"}]},"slot6":{"max":2,"prepared":[{"id":"CZsVsAnmUJbyReTg"},{"id":"unWYaqmWAF0w7UQr"}]}},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":33,"mod":0,"value":27},"tradition":{"value":"arcane"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"vknZjhozz53haMJZ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Arcane Innate Spells","sort":200000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":33,"mod":0,"value":25},"tradition":{"value":"arcane"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"CZsVsAnmUJbyReTg","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.WPXzPl7YbMEIGWfi"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/mislead.webp","name":"Mislead","sort":300000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":null,"description":{"value":"<p>You turn yourself @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.zJxUflt9np0q4yML]{Invisible} and create an illusory duplicate of yourself.

However, they are naturally scholarly creatures who would rather remain in their lairs studying esoteric lore than go off on a wild adventure. These aloof and stoic dragons also act as preservationists, guarding storehouses of ancient lore from destruction or perversion. Bronze dragons are principled and protective, but while their silver cousins are quick to crusade for justice, bronze dragons prefer to find an important location worthy of their protection and guard it against any attack or unwelcome intrusion.</p>\n<p>Bronze dragons' mastery over water and affinity for electricity means they are a boon to sailors caught in thunderstorms. A bronze dragon's enemies quickly discover neither cloudy sky nor turbulent sea provides shelter from their wrath. Bronze dragons lair along shorelines, often in partially submerged sea caves.</p>\n<p>While all dragons keep hoards of treasure, the hoard of a bronze dragon more resembles a vast library-with the shelves kept carefully above the waterline, of course. In addition to their collections of esoteric lore, bronze dragons keep treasures associated with the sea, such as beautiful scrimshaw, flawless pearls, and equipment inlaid with mother-of-pearl and abalone shell.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals' lives-and of their passing-always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don't seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water-though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other.</p>\n<p>In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts, other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes. Countless other types of dragons are sure to exist, including dragons on far-flung planes of existence and, it is rumored, primeval dragons who soar between the stars.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":23,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"},{"acuity":"imprecise","range":60,"type":"scent"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":24},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":23},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":26}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":22},"arcana":{"base":28},"athletics":{"base":24},"diplomacy":{"base":23},"intimidation":{"base":23},"occultism":{"base":24},"stealth":{"base":22}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"huge"},"value":["amphibious","dragon","good","lawful","water"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.oj0vzfjflUc3xMBo"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"oLdrCmarnzd62kA8","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"hN4sFUVjQOMN0Gvq","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Arcane Prepared Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":4},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"prepared"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{"slot0":{"max":5,"prepared":[{"id":"nW6icMKgwe46w8fi"},{"id":"ArGHu4cGP8iFuIJg"},{"id":"tIWZ5HiY8oD4d6el"},{"id":"F0ibCzzNiaVerzmU"},{"id":"rIIasZ7WiIjXZN3T"}]},"slot1":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"7qqkw6V0ueuEyWfj"},{"id":"i7v0WOSNR9DWd61b"},{"id":"cXWNyVnAhJEMrXF7"}]},"slot2":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"lBmGAxRVX829kHKK"},{"id":"V1n3p77FcQoyCm5O"},{"id":"3HjbHhtHrqMRKvtP"}]},"slot3":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"55YVGIvBeg4LPmBZ"},{"id":"qVbDXbNhkmrdVssp"},{"id":"HqyVZjR7shkmVXvq"}]},"slot4":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"HM8YatGN718VhM9k"},{"id":"Ttkn8jC7PAwlLYoP"},{"id":"LNUcfb3KKiARuzx7"}]}},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":29,"mod":0,"value":23},"tradition":{"value":"arcane"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"6V0TnokqVZcRCz7V","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Arcane Innate Spells","sort":200000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":27,"mod":0,"value":19},"tradition":{"value":"arcane"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"HM8YatGN718VhM9k","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.GaRQlC9Yw1BGKHfN"},"img":"icons/creatures/slimes/slime-face-teeth-purple.webp","name":"Crushing Despair","sort":300000,"system":{"area":{"type":"cone","value":30},"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":{"save":{"basic":false,"statistic":"will"}},"description":{"value":"<p>You inflict despair on creatures in the area.

They take pleasure in dominating these creatures, and they demand tribute from their supplicants. Those who anger or disappoint end up eaten or reduced to ash. They command their enslaved minions to constantly build onto their lairs, carving out new tunnels and designing cunning traps that ensure the dragon's security.</p>\n<p>Driven by their arrogance, red dragons are the most likely of the chromatic dragons to ravage settlements.

It's nearly impossible to treat with white dragons, not because they lack the capacity to do so, but because they just don't care to. They are as difficult to deal with as they are quick to anger, and they become incensed at almost anything. When a white dragon does speak, it spews threats, inane jokes, and incoherent babbling as a prelude to attacking-and when the attack comes, it's bloody and relentless.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, white dragons prefer very cold, remote locations that are far from people. Dwelling on glacial mountaintops or in ice caverns beneath forbidding tundra, they treat the lands around them as their own personal hunting grounds. They fly out to feed or terrorize other creatures, especially those who trespass near the dragon's territory, then bring any treasure back to be displayed in icy niches in their lairs. They collect all kinds of valuables, with a slight preference for items with high utility-such as tools, trade goods, and fine food-over coins or jewels. The ability to shape ice lets white dragons rearrange their lairs exactly to their specifications, and they take great pride in how they've decorated their homes over the years.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons.

Copper dragons are hedonists who are quick to indulge in simple pleasures, but they're also sympathetic to other creatures, slow to pass judgment, and careful to always examine a situation from as many perspectives as possible. This philosophy has its drawbacks, however, as copper dragons are susceptible to negative influences and prone to forgiving the less serious evil acts performed by their chromatic cousins and other cruel creatures. Copper dragons also have a difficult time keeping their temper in check once they are roused to anger.</p>\n<p>Copper dragons tend to lair in warm or temperate hills, but due to their nature, they move their lairs every few years. They sometimes live among other people, especially any dwarves who reside nearby. Some copper dragons even worship gods typically worshipped only by humanoids. Among these dragons, worship of Cayden Cailean is most popular, as they see his love of freedom and penchant for alcohol aligning with the typical copper dragon mindset.</p>\n<p>A copper dragon's combat tactics are as unorthodox as its sense of humor, as it is more likely to use mockery and tricks than outright strength to win its battles. As a copper dragon ages, it perfects jokes capable of rendering its foes helpless with laughter.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals' lives-and of their passing-always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don't seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water-though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other.</p>\n<p>In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts, other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes.

The key to understanding green dragons is to understand their obsession with knowledge and self-discipline. Any careful approach that takes advantage of a green dragon's fixations may end in a diplomatic outcome, but any misstep or slight can provoke a savage attack. Like most chromatic dragons, green dragons do not suffer fools-and the threshold for what they consider foolish is very low.</p>\n<p>Though more open than their chromatic cousins to dealing with other creatures and dragons, green dragons prefer an isolated and quiet life. They tend to lair in the most forbidding parts of a forest, surrounded by tangled thickets, or else at the heart of some dismal gulch. If the terrain is suitable, some green dragons make their home in natural caves, which they expand to suit their needs.</p>\n<p>Green dragons' pride leads them to see to the preservation of their forest homes. They feel that a verdant and lush forest is something that they alone have cultivated. This leads some green dragons to follow the path of druidism, though most prefer to study the arcane arts and occult lore. Most of them delve deeply into one particular field of study, and correspond with other scholars in the field by adopting a pen name that hides their true nature. Regardless of their chosen focus, green dragons seek to improve themselves, and their desire for knowledge makes them more likely to deal diplomatically with other creatures in order to obtain new information.</p>\n<p>Their hoards are typically well kept, organized, and filled with tomes of lore and scrolls of magic along with antiquities they collect for their own inscrutable reasons. Many of these treasures come from across the globe, and many an adventurer has survived an encounter with a green dragon by stroking its ego and plying it with rare artifacts or lost lore from ancient cultures.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty-be it by claw, tooth, or breath-and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":30,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"},{"acuity":"imprecise","range":60,"type":"scent"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":30},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":29},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":32}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":25},"arcana":{"base":32},"athletics":{"base":30},"deception":{"base":27},"diplomacy":{"base":31},"intimidation":{"base":31},"nature":{"base":28},"occultism":{"base":34},"society":{"base":31},"stealth":{"base":29,"note":"camouflage"}},"traits":{"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"grg"},"value":["amphibious","dragon","evil","lawful"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.p2ECLKUzZ0GhFg22"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"pFmaszqtsA2yt7dv","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"1uWYYut6bpKdXgNp","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Arcane Prepared Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":6},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"prepared"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{"slot0":{"max":5,"prepared":[{"id":"9tb03UOZVVPzefvd"},{"id":"5UiSWEqXPq9a69cP"},{"id":"Yr1JzshLNOri9824"},{"id":"jfMvcHvwmGE9Hv1P"},{"id":"NZr1bwElMwO0vS6A"}]},"slot1":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"AJpMU9nKNlL41tQK"},{"id":"QnyLmolfPR3NLz8p"},{"id":"JSeiAljhTooaRxp1"}]},"slot2":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"xdGx08BcaTIe0G5f"},{"id":"ZlCsCwpnq4kUa8DY"},{"id":"TGdb74Avf6PHjeSX"}]},"slot3":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"WMnOAYQUQ5APyxtI"},{"id":"PT4NKyZCNIvi8NaX"},{"id":"vMeaZlgjeN82kn6G"}]},"slot4":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"7OWdDu6HOF8YUyTx"},{"id":"Qw8ILF79hvUD3g7N"},{"id":"tDqJwb0fR4ih76i0"}]},"slot5":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"gfiWC2zn277uMngh"},{"id":"Ntjbxvl6D0YTarOL"},{"id":"wqF5295BSCfqNC4s"}]},"slot6":{"max":3,"prepared":[{"id":"O0KvKxkrGmC2nRyG"},{"id":"Pmp5HRCuZxD6fI9D"},{"id":"RvJC8GGy7EfD0p1V"}]}},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":35,"mod":0,"value":29},"tradition":{"value":"arcane"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"RjqqCquV2ghiNEdO","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Arcane Innate Spells","sort":200000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":35,"mod":0,"value":27},"tradition":{"value":"arcane"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"Pmp5HRCuZxD6fI9D","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.69L70wKfGDY66Mk9"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/teleport.webp","name":"Teleport","sort":300000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":null,"description":{"value":"<p>You and the targets are instantly transported to any location within range, as long as you can identify the location precisely both by its position relative to your starting position and by its appearance (or other identifying features).

They take pleasure in dominating these creatures, and they demand tribute from their supplicants. Those who anger or disappoint end up eaten or reduced to ash. They command their enslaved minions to constantly build onto their lairs, carving out new tunnels and designing cunning traps that ensure the dragon's security.</p>\n<p>Driven by their arrogance, red dragons are the most likely of the chromatic dragons to ravage settlements.

inevitables are enforcers of bargains and punishers of those who fail to uphold them. Their humanoid shape, ability to disguise themselves among a humanoid population, and diplomatic leanings make them the most approachable inevitables, and thus more likely to ally themselves with others. They are among the most talkative of all inevitables, naturally possessing a courtly grace and an encyclopedic knowledge of social customs, which they use to assist their efforts in gathering information on their targets or issuing challenges in a legal manner.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Aeons have always been the caretakers of reality and defenders of the natural order of balance. Each type of aeon takes on some form of duality in its manifestation and works either to shape the multiverse within the aspects of this duality in some way, or to correct imbalances to the perfect order of existence. Aeons can bring weal or woe when they appear in a region, and their machinations can raise a nation, raze it, or restore it from ruin. Their reasons are their own, and they rarely share their motivations with others-they simply create the results they insist through their strange envisioning communication are necessary to maintain the balance of the multiverse.</p>\n<p>As a result of recent shifts in reality, aeons have begun to reassert a presence in the perfect planar city of Axis. To the aeons, this is merely the latest in a recurring cycle, albeit one that mortals have not yet borne witness to. Once regarded as an independent faction, the living machines known as inevitables are now revealed as having been agents of the aeons all along, and while inevitables have their own shared themes and features, they are very much living but constructed manifestations of the aeons' war against imbalance-particularly with regard to how this war is waged against the forces of chaos.</p>\n<p>Aeons have a name for this cyclic return, in which they welcome the industrious axiomites back to their fold and bring the inevitables once again under their control: the \"Convergence.\" At the onset of the Convergence, a council of pleroma aeons appeared in the Eternal City of Axis, where they revealed that axiomites were wayward aeons, split off long ago to pursue the act of creation. With the latest cycle of change it was time for the axiomites and their creations, the inevitables, to rejoin the aeon cause. While most axiomites and inevitables fell in line, realizing perhaps on a fundamental level of reality that what the aeons said was the truth, some refused to heed the call and waited for the wrath of the aeons-but that wrath has yet to come. The dual-natured aeons have responded to those who have declined in confusing ways. With some they treat and even bargain, while a handful of others they have destroyed, and a few have been exterminated by the axiomites and allied inevitables. But most of these quiet insurgents they leave alone, allowing these axiomites to continue to create in peace and the inevitables to continue with their duties. How-or if-this Convergence will end is as little understood as the aeons themselves.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"(+27 to detect lies)","mod":23,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":23},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":24},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":22}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":22},"athletics":{"base":27},"deception":{"base":20},"diplomacy":{"base":20},"survival":{"base":22}},"spellcasting":{"rituals":{"dc":32}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"med"},"value":["aeon","inevitable","lawful","monitor"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.PgBsMyjMITjQnCs8"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"Pl3J94dvVY159G64","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"rc2RmYmto2nlnmbA","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Occult Innate Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":18,"mod":0,"value":8},"tradition":{"value":"occult"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"dFowQ2IuOkiJTAt0","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.fI20AVwOzJMHXRdo"},"img":"icons/magic/light/projectile-stars-blue.webp","name":"Levitate","sort":200000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":null,"description":{"value":"<p>You defy gravity and levitate the target 5 feet off the ground.

These little constructs are created for a variety of reasons-such as to serve as companions or servants-but their free will means their obedience to their creators is hardly a given. Followers of Pharasma generally abhor soulbound dolls, viewing them as a perversion of the natural cycle of souls, and those who worship the Lady of Graves see the destruction of a soulbound doll, regardless of the construct's alignment, as an important service to the Great Beyond. Soulbound dolls are the simplest in a series of soulbound constructs including human-sized soulbound mannequins, powerful soulbound shells, and sentinel soulbound terra-cotta warriors. Creating them from unwilling living creatures is evil, and an unwilling donor can resist the process with a successful Will save against the creator's Craft DC, ruining the doll if not preventing the donor's death. A non-evil doll can only be crafted from the soul of a person who has given consent to such use before their death occurred</p>\n<p>Soulbound dolls encountered by adventurers are typically guardians of some sort; despite their diminutive size, the soul fragment's power makes the doll's flst more dangerous than a casual observer would expect. Further, it grants the doll a single spell of outsized power given its stature. Because of their autonomy and remarkable intelligence, soulbound dolls are occasionally employed by their crafters as administrators over much more powerful but mindless constructs such as golems, allowing such dolls to control defenses far beyond their own capabilities. Though soulbound dolls contain a small fragment of a soul extracted during or shortly after a person's death, this doesn't affect the deceased's resurrection or progress to the afterlife. This extraction process is lethal to otherwise-living prospective soul donors, though there are rumors of more expensive processes that allows someone to donate a fragment of a living soul without repercussions.</p>\n<p>The soul fragment resides in a soul focus gem typically embedded in the doll's neck or chest. The soul fragment isn't static, and the doll continues to learn from its initial state, meaning its personality and abilities can change, possibly growing closer to the donor's or moving farther afield on its own individual path. The soulbound doll's focus gem retains the doll's memories even after the doll's destruction. The the intact soul focus gem of a destroyed doll can even be placed into a new doll body by someone knowledgeable in the creation of soulbound creatures, effectively reconstituting the soulbound doll.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":8,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":7},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":10},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":6}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":8},"occultism":{"base":4},"stealth":{"base":8}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"tiny"},"value":["construct","soulbound"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.Pl3J94dvVY159G64"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"pL4sS2HZtGAryKnN","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"pm2fdTcLLvGAYrvI","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Divine Innate Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":26,"mod":0,"value":16},"tradition":{"value":"divine"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"0UQMVUtzl19eLwjS","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.VlNcjmYyu95vOUe8"},"img":"icons/magic/symbols/ring-circle-smoke-blue.webp","name":"Dimension Door","sort":200000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":null,"description":{"value":"<p>Opening a door that bypasses normal space, you instantly transport yourself and any items you're wearing and holding from your current space to a clear space within range you can see.

When an entire fishing village disappears overnight, sea devils are the first suspects.</p>\n<p>Far from mindless monstrosities, sea devils are terribly intelligent, with a cunning limited only by their strict adherence to hierarchy. They call themselves \"sahuagin\" but have wholly embraced their enemies' name for their kind as their own. Their cultural militancy enables sea devils to act in concert to perform grand acts of sabotage, marauding, and pillaging, and only the strongest (and most conniving) members of the tribe make it to the top of the social ladder. For all their discipline, however, sea devils are widely known to snap into murderous frenzies at the scent of blood. Even the best-laid plans can fall apart when a sea devil breaks ranks to revel in the spilled blood of their victims, an indulgence that can quickly cause a chain reaction of bloodthirsty ecstasy throughout an entire raiding party. For this reason, sea devils typically capture landborne quarry using nets and ropes, dragging them to the depths of the sea before making even a single incision.</p>\n<p>Among sea devil society, individuals are rewarded based on their performance during hunts and shore excursions, with rebels and outliers quickly culled from the ranks.

Copper dragons are hedonists who are quick to indulge in simple pleasures, but they're also sympathetic to other creatures, slow to pass judgment, and careful to always examine a situation from as many perspectives as possible. This philosophy has its drawbacks, however, as copper dragons are susceptible to negative influences and prone to forgiving the less serious evil acts performed by their chromatic cousins and other cruel creatures. Copper dragons also have a difficult time keeping their temper in check once they are roused to anger.</p>\n<p>Copper dragons tend to lair in warm or temperate hills, but due to their nature, they move their lairs every few years. They sometimes live among other people, especially any dwarves who reside nearby. Some copper dragons even worship gods typically worshipped only by humanoids. Among these dragons, worship of Cayden Cailean is most popular, as they see his love of freedom and penchant for alcohol aligning with the typical copper dragon mindset.</p>\n<p>A copper dragon's combat tactics are as unorthodox as its sense of humor, as it is more likely to use mockery and tricks than outright strength to win its battles. As a copper dragon ages, it perfects jokes capable of rendering its foes helpless with laughter.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals' lives-and of their passing-always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don't seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water-though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other.</p>\n<p>In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts, other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes. Countless other types of dragons are sure to exist, including dragons on far-flung planes of existence and, it is rumored, primeval dragons who soar between the

Dragons in particular are viewed with a deferential awe, and kobolds eagerly offer their services to such mighty and glorious creatures when they can.

Copper dragons are hedonists who are quick to indulge in simple pleasures, but they're also sympathetic to other creatures, slow to pass judgment, and careful to always examine a situation from as many perspectives as possible. This philosophy has its drawbacks, however, as copper dragons are susceptible to negative influences and prone to forgiving the less serious evil acts performed by their chromatic cousins and other cruel creatures. Copper dragons also have a difficult time keeping their temper in check once they are roused to anger.</p>\n<p>Copper dragons tend to lair in warm or temperate hills, but due to their nature, they move their lairs every few years. They sometimes live among other people, especially any dwarves who reside nearby. Some copper dragons even worship gods typically worshipped only by humanoids. Among these dragons, worship of Cayden Cailean is most popular, as they see his love of freedom and penchant for alcohol aligning with the typical copper dragon mindset.</p>\n<p>A copper dragon's combat tactics are as unorthodox as its sense of humor, as it is more likely to use mockery and tricks than outright strength to win its battles. As a copper dragon ages, it perfects jokes capable of rendering its foes helpless with laughter.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals' lives-and of their passing-always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don't seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water-though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other.</p>\n<p>In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts, other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes.

These little constructs are created for a variety of reasons-such as to serve as companions or servants-but their free will means their obedience to their creators is hardly a given. Followers of Pharasma generally abhor soulbound dolls, viewing them as a perversion of the natural cycle of souls, and those who worship the Lady of Graves see the destruction of a soulbound doll, regardless of the construct's alignment, as an important service to the Great Beyond. Soulbound dolls are the simplest in a series of soulbound constructs including human-sized soulbound mannequins, powerful soulbound shells, and sentinel soulbound terra-cotta warriors. Creating them from unwilling living creatures is evil, and an unwilling donor can resist the process with a successful Will save against the creator's Craft DC, ruining the doll if not preventing the donor's death. A non-evil doll can only be crafted from the soul of a person who has given consent to such use before their death occurred</p>\n<p>Soulbound dolls encountered by adventurers are typically guardians of some sort; despite their diminutive size, the soul fragment's power makes the doll's flst more dangerous than a casual observer would expect. Further, it grants the doll a single spell of outsized power given its stature. Because of their autonomy and remarkable intelligence, soulbound dolls are occasionally employed by their crafters as administrators over much more powerful but mindless constructs such as golems, allowing such dolls to control defenses far beyond their own capabilities. Though soulbound dolls contain a small fragment of a soul extracted during or shortly after a person's death, this doesn't affect the deceased's resurrection or progress to the afterlife. This extraction process is lethal to otherwise-living prospective soul donors, though there are rumors of more expensive processes that allows someone to donate a fragment of a living soul without repercussions.</p>\n<p>The soul fragment resides in a soul focus gem typically embedded in the doll's neck or chest. The soul fragment isn't static, and the doll continues to learn from its initial state, meaning its personality and abilities can change, possibly growing closer to the donor's or moving farther afield on its own individual path. The soulbound doll's focus gem retains the doll's memories even after the doll's destruction. The the intact soul focus gem of a destroyed doll can even be placed into a new doll body by someone knowledgeable in the creation of soulbound creatures, effectively reconstituting the soulbound doll.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":8,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":7},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":10},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":6}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":8},"occultism":{"base":4},"stealth":{"base":8}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"tiny"},"value":["construct","good","lawful","soulbound"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.RAjbVzWcfrPBbgkK"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"RDFvGocLW0OuHmlC","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"vNxkTMY4P5VmwDyM","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Primal Innate Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":38,"mod":0,"value":30},"tradition":{"value":"primal"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"ruegelYfs7DftAom","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.XkDCzMIyc0YOjw05"},"img":"icons/magic/lightning/bolts-salvo-clouds-sky.webp","name":"Control Weather","sort":200000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":null,"description":{"value":"<p>You alter the weather, making it calm and normal for the season or choosing up to two effects based on the season.</p>\n<p>You can't specifically control the manifestations, such as the exact path of a tornado or the targets of lightning strikes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Autumn</strong> cold weather, fog, mild heat, sleet</li>\n<li><strong>Spring</strong> drizzle, heat, hurricane, sleet, thunderstorm, tornado</li>\n<li><strong>Summer</strong> drizzle, downpour, extreme heat, hail, heat</li>\n<li><strong>Winter</strong> blizzard, mild cold, extreme cold, thaw</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You change the weather as desired and can affect a larger area (up to a 5-mile-radius circle), or a longer duration (any number of additional d12 hours, up to 16d12).</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You change the weather as desired.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You fail to change the weather as desired.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The weather changes in an unanticipated way, determined by the GM but generally as contradictory to your true desires as possible (for instance, a terrible storm emerges when you would prefer good weather).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (9th)</strong> You can create unseasonable weather and contradictory weather effects, such as extreme cold and a hurricane.

These little constructs are created for a variety of reasons-such as to serve as companions or servants-but their free will means their obedience to their creators is hardly a given. Followers of Pharasma generally abhor soulbound dolls, viewing them as a perversion of the natural cycle of souls, and those who worship the Lady of Graves see the destruction of a soulbound doll, regardless of the construct's alignment, as an important service to the Great Beyond. Soulbound dolls are the simplest in a series of soulbound constructs including human-sized soulbound mannequins, powerful soulbound shells, and sentinel soulbound terra-cotta warriors. Creating them from unwilling living creatures is evil, and an unwilling donor can resist the process with a successful Will save against the creator's Craft DC, ruining the doll if not preventing the donor's death. A non-evil doll can only be crafted from the soul of a person who has given consent to such use before their death occurred</p>\n<p>Soulbound dolls encountered by adventurers are typically guardians of some sort; despite their diminutive size, the soul fragment's power makes the doll's flst more dangerous than a casual observer would expect. Further, it grants the doll a single spell of outsized power given its stature. Because of their autonomy and remarkable intelligence, soulbound dolls are occasionally employed by their crafters as administrators over much more powerful but mindless constructs such as golems, allowing such dolls to control defenses far beyond their own capabilities. Though soulbound dolls contain a small fragment of a soul extracted during or shortly after a person's death, this doesn't affect the deceased's resurrection or progress to the afterlife. This extraction process is lethal to otherwise-living prospective soul donors, though there are rumors of more expensive processes that allows someone to donate a fragment of a living soul without repercussions.</p>\n<p>The soul fragment resides in a soul focus gem typically embedded in the doll's neck or chest. The soul fragment isn't static, and the doll continues to learn from its initial state, meaning its personality and abilities can change, possibly growing closer to the donor's or moving farther afield on its own individual path. The soulbound doll's focus gem retains the doll's memories even after the doll's destruction. The the intact soul focus gem of a destroyed doll can even be placed into a new doll body by someone knowledgeable in the creation of soulbound creatures, effectively reconstituting the soulbound doll.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":8,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":7},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":10},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":6}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":8},"occultism":{"base":4},"stealth":{"base":8}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"tiny"},"value":["construct","evil","lawful","soulbound"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.RizAUQHtPy0YRUyt"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"rJgUpdXBCMBrsJFf","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"vNXYpdzNtNydM0Yh","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Occult Innate Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":18,"mod":0,"value":8},"tradition":{"value":"occult"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"uvTOZ33w1RVsOS0h","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.fI20AVwOzJMHXRdo"},"img":"icons/magic/light/projectile-stars-blue.webp","name":"Levitate","sort":200000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":null,"description":{"value":"<p>You defy gravity and levitate the target 5 feet off the ground.

These little constructs are created for a variety of reasons-such as to serve as companions or servants-but their free will means their obedience to their creators is hardly a given. Followers of Pharasma generally abhor soulbound dolls, viewing them as a perversion of the natural cycle of souls, and those who worship the Lady of Graves see the destruction of a soulbound doll, regardless of the construct's alignment, as an important service to the Great Beyond. Soulbound dolls are the simplest in a series of soulbound constructs including human-sized soulbound mannequins, powerful soulbound shells, and sentinel soulbound terra-cotta warriors. Creating them from unwilling living creatures is evil, and an unwilling donor can resist the process with a successful Will save against the creator's Craft DC, ruining the doll if not preventing the donor's death. A non-evil doll can only be crafted from the soul of a person who has given consent to such use before their death occurred</p>\n<p>Soulbound dolls encountered by adventurers are typically guardians of some sort; despite their diminutive size, the soul fragment's power makes the doll's flst more dangerous than a casual observer would expect. Further, it grants the doll a single spell of outsized power given its stature. Because of their autonomy and remarkable intelligence, soulbound dolls are occasionally employed by their crafters as administrators over much more powerful but mindless constructs such as golems, allowing such dolls to control defenses far beyond their own capabilities. Though soulbound dolls contain a small fragment of a soul extracted during or shortly after a person's death, this doesn't affect the deceased's resurrection or progress to the afterlife. This extraction process is lethal to otherwise-living prospective soul donors, though there are rumors of more expensive processes that allows someone to donate a fragment of a living soul without repercussions.</p>\n<p>The soul fragment resides in a soul focus gem typically embedded in the doll's neck or chest. The soul fragment isn't static, and the doll continues to learn from its initial state, meaning its personality and abilities can change, possibly growing closer to the donor's or moving farther afield on its own individual path. The soulbound doll's focus gem retains the doll's memories even after the doll's destruction. The the intact soul focus gem of a destroyed doll can even be placed into a new doll body by someone knowledgeable in the creation of soulbound creatures, effectively reconstituting the soulbound doll.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":8,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":7},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":10},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":6}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":8},"occultism":{"base":4},"stealth":{"base":8}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"tiny"},"value":["construct","lawful","soulbound"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.rJgUpdXBCMBrsJFf"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"S35DifoycBwkxaGq","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"rNMUpQjQil41A67R","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Arcane Innate Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":40,"mod":0,"value":30},"tradition":{"value":"arcane"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"QOBOciGYNGMMzHab","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Demilich Eye Gems (Arcane)","sort":200000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":1},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":40,"value":30},"tradition":{"value":"arcane"},"traits":{},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"ioPnzskXdQNmr1OV","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.FEsuyf203wTNE2et"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/fatal-aria.webp","name":"Wail of the Banshee","sort":300000,"system":{"area":{"type":"emanation","value":40},"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{"0":{"category":null,"formula":"8d10","kinds":["damage"],"materials":[],"type":"void"}},"defense":{"save":{"basic":false,"statistic":"fortitude"}},"description":{"value":"<p>Your scream chills the souls of enemies that hear it.

As years pass, the lich's body crumbles to dust, leaving only the skull as the seat of its necromantic power. The lich enters a sort of torpor, its mind left wandering the planes in search of ever greater mysteries. The lich gradually loses the ability to cast spells and its magic items slowly subsume into its new form. Void energy concentrates around the skull, causing some of its bones and teeth to petrify with power and turn into blight crystals. The resulting lich skull, embedded with arcane gemstones and suffused with palpably powerful magic, forms a creature called a demilich.</p>\n<p>Despite its near-constant state of inactivity, a demilich grows restless from time to time, especially when living creatures draw near. Only then does the demilich's hunger for life stir once more, causing it to lash out with terrifying bursts of power in attempts to consume vital energy. Unlike an ordinary lich, should the demilich's skull be destroyed, its bond to the world is permanently severed, although some theorize that even then it is not truly slain. Rather, some think that once the demilich is destroyed, its foul and tormented mind is finally free to wander the planes and find new ways to enact its will. For the short-lived common folk of the Material Plane, this is good enough, though eons later a demilich may reappear in the region it once inhabited with a new—and even more insidious—agenda.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>To gain more time to complete their goals, some desperate spellcasters pursue immortality by embracing undeath. After long years of research and the creation of a special container called a phylactery, a spellcaster takes the final step by imbibing a deadly concoction or casting dreadful incantations that transform them into a lich. While most undertake this drastic plan to continue their work or fulfill some long-term plan, others become liches because they fear death or to fulfill some malevolent purpose, such as long-sworn revenge. Regardless, the result is permanent and carries with it the potential to alter history—both that of those who transform themselves and of the countless mortals that will inevitably suffer as a result of a lich's new power.</p>\n<p>After its metamorphosis, a lich often finds some quiet place to dwell, typically protected by a variety of guardians and traps, for two primary purposes. First, a lich requires solitude in order to plan its elaborate schemes, and second, few mortals (if any) deign to interact with these legendarily corrupt necromancers. One reason begets the other, as the self-imposed isolation of a lich often drives the lich insane, further solidifying its separation from civilization. The longer a lich lives, the more meticulous a planner it becomes, secreting itself within a labyrinth of deadly puzzles, misdirection, and monsters. A lich's servants and guardians are absolutely loyal, either due to their nature (such as constructs or other undead) or as a result of compulsion using powerful magic. Many liches go mad, in time, and the nature of a lich's lair is a good indicator of the undead's current mental state.</p>\n<p>For all the protections it arrays around itself, a lich will go to greater lengths to guard its phylactery, as it knows that the destruction of this magical container spells doom for the lich. A lich is notoriously difficult to bargain with, though the threat of damaging its phylactery is a sure way to gain the upper hand in such a negotiation.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":19,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":23},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":27},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":23}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":25},"arcana":{"base":32},"deception":{"base":26},"occultism":{"base":30},"religion":{"base":21},"stealth":{"base":25}},"traits":{"rarity":"rare","size":{"value":"tiny"},"value":["evil","undead","unholy"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.S35DifoycBwkxaGq"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"S8iX8sPaYFFYDoUq","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"XsEpINoWybq0qnQN","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Jaws","sort":100000,"system":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"custom":"","value":[]},"bonus":{"value":11},"damageRolls":{"k1n8i3j9usbq1hyk36xl":{"damage":"1d10+4","damageType":"piercing"}},"description":{"value":""},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":"jaws","traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["unarmed"]},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"melee","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"M6OcH3aIVdTWr7gq","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Tail","sort":200000,"system":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"custom":"","value":[]},"bonus":{"value":11},"damageRolls":{"tqh5zrktpw50jy8ygx9o":{"damage":"1d8+4","damageType":"bludgeoning"}},"description":{"value":""},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":"tail","traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["agile"]},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"melee","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"i8xGkDyTBirx7HaW","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Blood Scent","sort":300000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"interaction","description":{"value":"<p>The bunyip can smell blood in the water from up to 1 mile away.</p>"},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":[]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"action","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"zbg9eaOONakDkuma","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Item.hFtNbo1LKYCoDy2O"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Reaction.webp","name":"Aquatic Opportunity (Special)","sort":400000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"reaction"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"defensive","description":{"value":"<p>As Attack of Opportunity, but both the bunyip and the triggering creature must be in water.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>@Localize[PF2E.NPC.Abilities.Glossary.AttackOfOpportunity]</p>"},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"},"rules":[],"slug":"attack-of-opportunity","traits":{"rarity":"common","value":[]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"action","effects":[]},{"_id":"8WFwsPMOCNHrJBF8","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/FreeAction.webp","name":"Blood Frenzy","sort":500000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"free"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"offensive","description":{"value":"<p><strong>Requirements</strong> The bunyip is not @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.HL2l2VRSaQHu9lUw]{Fatigued} or already in a frenzy.</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> The bunyip deals bleed damage to a living creature.</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> The bunyip flies into a frenzy that lasts 1 minute.

For hundreds of years, bunyips were widely regarded as nothing more than folk tales, and even now that their existence as a species has been proven, the existence of any particular bunyip in a local area is often met with heavy skepticism. While their limited shapechanging abilities are no doubt a significant part of the reason for this air of mystery, another major factor is that the aquatic creatures rarely hunt humanoids, preferring to eat smaller animals. Most bunyips avoid human contact, except when one wanders too close to their den or favorite hunting spot, at which point the territorial bunyip attacks with swift and terrible ferocity.

In this way, two heads are better than one-ettins regularly find employ in the ranks of giant or orc armies as sentries and guards. The benefits of an ettin security detail are obvious: because it has a shared stomach, an ettin requires only the same amount of food as one typical ogre, yet its two sets of eyes make it twice as observant. An ettin never complains for lack of company, either. The ettin's two heads are uniquely content to squabble and converse between themselves, and though they bicker incessantly, most couldn't dream of life without the other.

Clay golems have the power to lay curses upon their victims as punishment for intrusion, leading many to believe that these oft-ancient constructs have a touch of the divine to them. While this idea has little basis in reality, superstitious folk still tread lightly around statues that resemble clay golems even in the slightest.</p>\n<p>The animating force within a clay golem is unusually unstable, making the golem prone to entering a berserk frenzy when damaged. Entire treasuries have been totally ruined as a result of a rampaging clay golem, so crafters do well to make sure their golems are maintained and in good working order-or otherwise place them on the other side of the door from the treasures they wish to protect.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Crafted of base materials and then magically animated into a powerful guardian, the legendary golem is a living construct that mindlessly obeys its creator's commands-often continuing to do so for years or even centuries after its creator's death. There exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure vitality energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem's unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons.</p>\n<p>Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures.

Though it has no mind, it can still go into a berserk rage when harmed, giving it a faint semblance of emotion. Flesh golems guard the laboratories and charnel houses of fleshwarpers and necromancers who feel no compunctions about desecrating corpses for their own ends. Though the first flesh golem is believed to have been a misguided attempt to create from simple base elements, these monstrosities are far from human. In isolated cases, echoes of a personality might rise in a flesh golem if the brain used as part of its construction belonged to a particularly powerful personality, but such tragic instances are (thankfully) rare in the extreme.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Crafted of base materials and then magically animated into a powerful guardian, the legendary golem is a living construct that mindlessly obeys its creator's commands-often continuing to do so for years or even centuries after its creator's death. There exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure vitality energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem's unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons.</p>\n<p>Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures.

The mindless ooze or other creature that just had its food stolen rarely holds a grudge and simply slithers off to find a new quarry, letting the drakauthix digest the corpse in peace.

Although they typically make their lairs among the highlands, the pursuit of justice leads silver dragons to travel far and wide-often into the very heart of realms overrun by evil. These exemplars of righteousness are ceaseless in their determination to help the weak, spread honor, and stamp out evil.</p>\n<p>Silver dragons are sleek and sinuous. Their hides resemble nothing so much as a suit of gleaming armor, lending further credence to the popular myth that silver dragons are the paladins of dragonkind. The zeal with which they seek out, confront, and defeat evil is unsurpassed even among their metallic cousins, and they adhere to strict codes of honor usually passed down from parent to hatchling. On occasion, they instead learn these codes from trusted mentors, usually other silver dragons or gold dragons. As they age, they become even more dedicated to their codes, often adding new and even more restrictive clauses to the systems that guide their behavior.</p>\n<p>Silver dragons are incredibly altruistic and regularly consort with the citizens of goodly societies, of which they consider themselves protectors and guides. In addition to responding to evil threats, silver dragons work to prevent evil from taking root in the first place, and they ensure mortals under their care are well fed, educated, and treated with dignity. Although silver dragons can seem overzealous or even eager to join the fight against evil, they know that the best way to rid the world of corruption is to stamp out strife and disillusionment at their source, not to passively sit back and watch it grow into an unsolvable problem. Silver dragons can be vindictive, but they can also be forgiving; for evildoers who seek to atone for their sins and turn over a new leaf, the support of a silver dragon is both unwavering and invaluable.</p>\n<p>Many silver dragons are also drawn to religious endeavors, venerating deities such as Iomedae, Sarenrae, and other deities concerned with justice, virtue, and redemption.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals' lives-and of their passing-always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don't seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water-though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other.</p>\n<p>In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts, other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes.

Their articulated joints and sturdy armored bodies require great care and mathematical precision to craft, and regular cleaning and oiling ensure they don't rust over the ages. With proper care, iron golems can remain in good shape for thousands of years, being passed down for generations, as long as they aren't destroyed by meddlesome adventurers. In addition to their incredible strength, iron golems possess a potent toxic breath weapon that is often more than enough to dispatch entire groups of opponents.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Crafted of base materials and then magically animated into a powerful guardian, the legendary golem is a living construct that mindlessly obeys its creator's commands-often continuing to do so for years or even centuries after its creator's death. There exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure vitality energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem's unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons.</p>\n<p>Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts-so-called \"golem manuals\"-are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.</p>\n<p>Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question.

Although they typically make their lairs among the highlands, the pursuit of justice leads silver dragons to travel far and wide-often into the very heart of realms overrun by evil. These exemplars of righteousness are ceaseless in their determination to help the weak, spread honor, and stamp out evil.</p>\n<p>Silver dragons are sleek and sinuous. Their hides resemble nothing so much as a suit of gleaming armor, lending further credence to the popular myth that silver dragons are the paladins of dragonkind. The zeal with which they seek out, confront, and defeat evil is unsurpassed even among their metallic cousins, and they adhere to strict codes of honor usually passed down from parent to hatchling. On occasion, they instead learn these codes from trusted mentors, usually other silver dragons or gold dragons. As they age, they become even more dedicated to their codes, often adding new and even more restrictive clauses to the systems that guide their behavior.</p>\n<p>Silver dragons are incredibly altruistic and regularly consort with the citizens of goodly societies, of which they consider themselves protectors and guides. In addition to responding to evil threats, silver dragons work to prevent evil from taking root in the first place, and they ensure mortals under their care are well fed, educated, and treated with dignity. Although silver dragons can seem overzealous or even eager to join the fight against evil, they know that the best way to rid the world of corruption is to stamp out strife and disillusionment at their source, not to passively sit back and watch it grow into an unsolvable problem. Silver dragons can be vindictive, but they can also be forgiving; for evildoers who seek to atone for their sins and turn over a new leaf, the support of a silver dragon is both unwavering and invaluable.</p>\n<p>Many silver dragons are also drawn to religious endeavors, venerating deities such as Iomedae, Sarenrae, and other deities concerned with justice, virtue, and redemption.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals' lives-and of their passing-always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don't seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water-though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other.</p>\n<p>In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts, other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes. Countless other types of dragons are sure to exist, including dragons on far-flung planes of existence and, it is rumored, primeval dragons who soar between the stars.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"fog vision","mod":26,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"},{"acuity":"imprecise","range":60,"type":"scent"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":26},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":23},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":28}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":21},"athletics":{"base":27},"diplomacy":{"base":25},"intimidation":{"base":27},"medicine":{"base":24},"religion":{"base":24},"society":{"base":20}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"huge"},"value":["cold","dragon","good","lawful"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.tl1aGbwuPPUDKHbN"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"tMxtnGthVV01wNQb","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"DxjaCZWO3bSIqi7x","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Arcane Innate Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":21,"mod":0,"value":13},"tradition":{"value":"arcane"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"KiV6ULlu39sXHCjs","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.5bTt2CvYHPvaR7QQ"},"img":"icons/magic/lightning/bolt-strike-explosion-purple.webp","name":"Plane Shift (to Astral Plane, Elemental Planes, or Material Plane Only)","sort":200000,"system":{"area":null,"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":null,"description":{"value":"<p>You and your allies traverse the barriers between planes of existence.

There exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure vitality energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem's unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons.</p>\n<p>Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking.

Unlike their leaders, who mask their actions using magical disguises, aboleths revel in their monstrous forms, appearing as primeval fish with tentacles. Masters of psychic manipulation, they are a species so ancient that they were present in the world when it was young, before the gods had turned their attention to the planet. They see all other life as something they have the right to control, so the idea that potential slaves might have faith in a higher power other than themselves enrages aboleths.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>In bygone millennia, aquatic monsters known as alghollthus used their occult powers to conquer and rule vast parts of the world. Their empires contained countless mortal slaves treated as little more than cattle. Alghollthus shaped their slaves and other creatures using mental manipulation and physically transformative magic. Aberrant horrors from faceless stalkers to mimics can be traced back to this meddling. The rulers of the alghollthu race, the so-called veiled masters, further shaped entire societies by assuming the forms of those they controlled. From the heights of power to the shadows of poverty, the veiled masters manipulated these societies according to their own dark designs, enslaving, killing, or horrifically transforming those who discovered their plans or acted against them.</p>\n<p>In time, the alghollthus grew frustrated with their increasingly upstart slave societies and sought to wipe the slate clean-both starting anew and punishing those who had become too willful and rebellious. They used incredible magical power to call forth a cataclysm, hoping to destroy the rebellious societies they'd manipulated. Yet they miscalculated the strength of faith and will to survive of their pawns and slaves, and in time the world and its empires recovered and grew strong once again-this time without alghollthu influence.</p>\n<p>Today, the alghollthus have retreated from their mass-scale manipulation of the surface world, and they have mostly remained within the deep aquatic realms where they still rule without question. Yet they have not abandoned their plots entirely, and the reemergence of servitor races like ugothols points to a frightening possibility-that the alghollthus have turned their hateful eyes to the surface once again.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":17,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":15},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":10},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":16}},"skills":{"athletics":{"base":16},"deception":{"base":15},"intimidation":{"base":15},"occultism":{"base":16}},"traits":{"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"huge"},"value":["aberration","aquatic","evil","lawful"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.tuIqEvsct8EO33xs"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"TZcDdN5o7s4alZNE","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"mNomS6NBwvlheidl","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Cube Face","sort":100000,"system":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"custom":"","value":["paralysis"]},"bonus":{"value":11},"damageRolls":{"xdjwadcumrlvj6hfe9dk":{"damage":"1d6","damageType":"acid"}},"description":{"value":""},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":[]},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"melee","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"InkIGrftuKGUgSoo","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Motion Sense 60 feet","sort":200000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"interaction","description":{"value":"<p>A gelatinous cube can sense nearby motion through vibration and air movement.</p>"},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":[]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"action","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"nXQUyl9JGuo2YBLG","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Transparent","sort":300000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"interaction","description":{"value":"<p>A gelatinous cube is so clear that it's difficult to spot.

While they may seem merely curious, brass dragons engage in this sort of conversation with the goal of keeping up to date on regional politics so they can anticipate future conflicts. Along the way, they create extensive information networks that begin with their own allies but stretch across all levels of humanoid society-networks which the brass dragon then uses to subtly assist settlements near their lair.

Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don't seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water-though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other. In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts, other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes.

They're often made to serve as works of art when at rest, so some golem crafters employ master sculptors to ensure the constructs make beautiful statues. Older stone golems might be weathered, with scuffed or cracked surfaces or missing noses and digits, but this weathering is largely cosmetic and doesn't adversely impact the golems' functionality.</p>\n<p>Tales tell of particularly immense stone golems residing in certain ancient ruins. Survivors from time-lost civilizations bent on carrying out orders from long-gone masters, these immense stone golems are much more powerful than most stone golems. They are always level 15 or higher and never smaller than Huge in size-most are Gargantuan. Because their size is so great and the structures they dwell in so dilapidated, the awakening of such a stone golem can cause surrounding structures to collapse, ancient foundations to buckle, and ceilings to come crashing down on foes. In addition to the statistics here, these massive stone golems attack with wide, sweeping strikes capable of knocking down multiple targets at once.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Crafted of base materials and then magically animated into a powerful guardian, the legendary golem is a living construct that mindlessly obeys its creator's commands-often continuing to do so for years or even centuries after its creator's death. There exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure vitality energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem's unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons.</p>\n<p>Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts-so-called \"golem manuals\"-are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.</p>\n<p>Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question.

Their brand of evil is organized, manipulative, and regal. Blue dragons often lair near or within cities and set out to bend the population to their will and gather hordes of servants. These dragons love spinning webs of conspiracy. A blue dragon's lackeys typically don't even realize that they serve a dragon, but instead think the protection money, tariffs, or taxes they are amassing is treasure for a cruel but legitimate master. In some ways, blue dragons even see their servants as a living hoard and value them like treasure. These dragons have been known to use these tactics even with their own chromatic cousins.</p>\n<p>Not all blue dragons work clandestinely. Some lord over desert tribes and hill people like vengeful gods, demanding both tribute and worship. No matter how blue dragons manage their underlings, their bearing is regal and their lairs palatial; they're universally intolerant of insubordination, incompetence, and embezzlement, and punish perpetrators with murderous efficiency.</p>\n<p>Blue dragons are also known for their use and mastery of illusion magic. They make use of illusions to augment their manipulations and bewilder their foes in battle. Blue dragons also have some control over water, but use this ability to destroy water, something quite dangerous for those who encounter them in their desert lairs.</p>\n<p>The ideal lair for a blue dragon contains multiple passages, rooms, and secret chambers. As social creatures, blue dragons prefer to host guests in comfort-but their dwellings should not be so public that just anyone can come calling. A force of guards keeps out intruders, and clever illusions conceal the edifice from prying eyes. Rather than a pile of coins or gems, a blue dragon's true hoard is the rich furnishings in its citadel- expensive art, ornate furniture, and architectural marvels.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty-be it by claw, tooth, or breath-and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":31,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"},{"acuity":"imprecise","range":60,"type":"scent"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":32},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":30},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":33}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":28},"arcana":{"base":33},"deception":{"base":35},"diplomacy":{"base":35},"intimidation":{"base":33},"society":{"base":35},"stealth":{"base":28},"survival":{"base":29}},"traits":{"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"huge"},"value":["dragon","electricity","evil","lawful"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.uPxh3VpA80zZdWfx"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"uQBOJfjtzEXvpLQz","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"ZrxAcxdGyfkm2kZf","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Pseudopod","sort":100000,"system":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"custom":"","value":["grab"]},"bonus":{"value":15},"damageRolls":{"lde52fl5xq95jsxliaa6":{"damage":"1d8+7","damageType":"bludgeoning"},"ffa7g2lvf7jv6gjy1fer":{"damage":"2d4","damageType":"acid"}},"description":{"value":""},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["unarmed"]},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"melee","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"MwXQ4IgNkQaCxTcf","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Motion Sense 60 feet","sort":200000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"interaction","description":{"value":"<p>A ochre jelly can sense nearby motion through vibration and air movement.</p>"},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":[]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"action","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"IWkgxOKsoYOGSw3E","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"Split","sort":300000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"defensive","description":{"value":"<p>Whenever an ochre jelly is hit by an attack or effect that would deal slashing, piercing, or electricity damage and the ochre jelly has at least 10 HP, the jelly splits into two identical jellies with half the original's HP.</p>\n<p>One jelly is in the same space as the original, and the other appears in an adjacent unoccupied space.

However, they are naturally scholarly creatures who would rather remain in their lairs studying esoteric lore than go off on a wild adventure. These aloof and stoic dragons also act as preservationists, guarding storehouses of ancient lore from destruction or perversion. Bronze dragons are principled and protective, but while their silver cousins are quick to crusade for justice, bronze dragons prefer to find an important location worthy of their protection and guard it against any attack or unwelcome intrusion.</p>\n<p>Bronze dragons' mastery over water and affinity for electricity means they are a boon to sailors caught in thunderstorms. A bronze dragon's enemies quickly discover neither cloudy sky nor turbulent sea provides shelter from their wrath. Bronze dragons lair along shorelines, often in partially submerged sea caves.</p>\n<p>While all dragons keep hoards of treasure, the hoard of a bronze dragon more resembles a vast library-with the shelves kept carefully above the waterline, of course. In addition to their collections of esoteric lore, bronze dragons keep treasures associated with the sea, such as beautiful scrimshaw, flawless pearls, and equipment inlaid with mother-of-pearl and abalone shell.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals' lives-and of their passing-always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don't seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water-though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other.</p>\n<p>In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts, other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes.

They call themselves \"sahuagin\" but have wholly embraced their enemies' name for their kind as their own. Their cultural militancy enables sea devils to act in concert to perform grand acts of sabotage, marauding, and pillaging, and only the strongest (and most conniving) members of the tribe make it to the top of the social ladder. For all their discipline, however, sea devils are widely known to snap into murderous frenzies at the scent of blood. Even the best-laid plans can fall apart when a sea devil breaks ranks to revel in the spilled blood of their victims, an indulgence that can quickly cause a chain reaction of bloodthirsty ecstasy throughout an entire raiding party. For this reason, sea devils typically capture landborne quarry using nets and ropes, dragging them to the depths of the sea before making even a single incision.</p>\n<p>Among sea devil society, individuals are rewarded based on their performance during hunts and shore excursions, with rebels and outliers quickly culled from the ranks. Every pup is given a fair chance, however, and even the lowest-born sea devil can strive for the rank of commander, general, or perhaps even king or queen. Sea devils in positions of leadership tend to be among the largest, most violent, and most calculating of their kind, and fully realized sea devils are skilled warriors capable of capturing entire villages on their own. The most powerful sea devils are mighty kings and queens who coordinate the activity of lesser sea devils across territories spanning leagues, foiling attempts at their positions via manufactured

Although they typically make their lairs among the highlands, the pursuit of justice leads silver dragons to travel far and wide-often into the very heart of realms overrun by evil. These exemplars of righteousness are ceaseless in their determination to help the weak, spread honor, and stamp out evil.</p>\n<p>Silver dragons are sleek and sinuous. Their hides resemble nothing so much as a suit of gleaming armor, lending further credence to the popular myth that silver dragons are the paladins of dragonkind. The zeal with which they seek out, confront, and defeat evil is unsurpassed even among their metallic cousins, and they adhere to strict codes of honor usually passed down from parent to hatchling. On occasion, they instead learn these codes from trusted mentors, usually other silver dragons or gold dragons. As they age, they become even more dedicated to their codes, often adding new and even more restrictive clauses to the systems that guide their behavior.</p>\n<p>Silver dragons are incredibly altruistic and regularly consort with the citizens of goodly societies, of which they consider themselves protectors and guides. In addition to responding to evil threats, silver dragons work to prevent evil from taking root in the first place, and they ensure mortals under their care are well fed, educated, and treated with dignity. Although silver dragons can seem overzealous or even eager to join the fight against evil, they know that the best way to rid the world of corruption is to stamp out strife and disillusionment at their source, not to passively sit back and watch it grow into an unsolvable problem. Silver dragons can be vindictive, but they can also be forgiving; for evildoers who seek to atone for their sins and turn over a new leaf, the support of a silver dragon is both unwavering and invaluable.</p>\n<p>Many silver dragons are also drawn to religious endeavors, venerating deities such as Iomedae, Sarenrae, and other deities concerned with justice, virtue, and redemption.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals' lives-and of their passing-always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don't seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water-though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other.</p>\n<p>In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts, other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes.

In their journey below, they fell to bickering and in-fighting, drawing the attention of sinister intelligences beyond their own. Whether it was the influence of a specific demon lord, the Rough Beast Rovagug, or some other fell force is unknown, but in that time the elves transformed both spiritually and physically, tainting their hearts with desires for cruelty, sadism, and violence. The hues of their eyes became sinister red or bleached white, and their flesh adopted an unearthly lavender sheen that made the drow instantly recognizable. The drow also developed potent magical abilities and resistances that further empowered them, if at the cost of their souls.</p>\n<p>Over the centuries to follow, the drow developed into a powerful, if violently dysfunctional society, influenced by the worship of demon lords and focused on providing power and glory to a relatively small collection of noble houses. Many of these noble houses are matriarchal in nature and all hold allegiance to a specific demon lord patron-but traditions of worship, warfare, and wizardry help to bind the oft-bickering houses together enough that drow society doesn't simply consume itself from within. Fear of earning the wrath of one's superior-be it a teacher, a parent, a commander, or the demon one worships-is the real bond holding drow society together, and this system is held in esteem by the lowliest drow servant and by the most powerful drow priestess alike.</p>\n<p>The drow are infamous throughout the world, but until recently most assumed stories of demon-worshipping, underground-dwelling elves were spooky legends crafted to share around a campfire.

They command the unwavering reverence of all other metallic dragons, who view gold dragons as their leaders and counselors. Golds rival the raw power of even red dragons, much to the chagrin of their chromatic cousins, and the two races are often regarded as bitter rivals. But despite their incredible power, gold dragons are fond of discourse and prefer to talk through solutions to problems rather than rely upon brute strength. Long-lived as they are, they necessarily take a wide view of all situations and never act without considering all possible options and outcomes. Because of this, gold dragons willingly converse with any creature that seeks them out, even evil chromatic dragons. Mortals might find this behavior strange, considering the long-standing war between chromatic and metallic dragons, but dragons know all too well that desperate situations sometimes call for drastic alliances. And although gold dragons might consider brief truces with their chromatic brethren in the case of world-ending threats, they also know when such alliances have run their course.</p>\n<p>When another metallic dragon faces a quandary or a foe beyond its own ability to overcome, its best option is often to seek the counsel of the eternally wise and gloriously righteous gold dragons. Locating these legendary beings is no easy task, however, for gold dragons are notoriously reclusive. Their intellect and wisdom is such that they prefer to ponder the great questions of life in seclusion, where they strive to formulate solutions to the world's most pressing problems. As a result, gold dragons are sometimes absent when metallic dragons gather together, or are missing from tribunals where their counsel would be beneficial. Impatient dragons sometimes begrudge gold dragons for this apparent unreliability, but such aspersions are usually a result of jealousy rather than any true criticism; in their hearts, other dragons know that few gold dragons purposefully exclude themselves from truly important matters.</p>\n<p>A gold dragon's incredible foresight and unparalleled enlightenment means they are unlikely to interfere in the business of individual mortals, though the rare person who captures the attention of a gold dragon is fortunate indeed, for there are few beings in the cosmos who can offer such prudent and considerate advice. Rulers and individuals in stations of high power have an easier time of garnering the aid of a gold dragon; entire wars have been avoided thanks to a gold dragon's last-minute intermediation.</p>\n<p>Gold dragons are often found in warm grasslands and savannas, lands where they can enjoy long, meditative flights without attracting the attention of potential enemies. They tend to sleep either out in the open in a barren, remote place, or within a heavily secreted or fortified lair, such as a forgotten sink hole or in the labyrinthine caverns of a terrestrial chasm. Gold dragons may enlist trusted servants and allies to guard their lairs, though many live truly solitary lives, preferring to protect their hoards with nonlethal traps and magical wards.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals' lives-and of their passing-always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don't seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water-though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other. In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts, other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes.

Followers of Pharasma generally abhor soulbound dolls, viewing them as a perversion of the natural cycle of souls, and those who worship the Lady of Graves see the destruction of a soulbound doll, regardless of the construct's alignment, as an important service to the Great Beyond. Soulbound dolls are the simplest in a series of soulbound constructs including human-sized soulbound mannequins, powerful soulbound shells, and sentinel soulbound terra-cotta warriors.

Further, it grants the doll a single spell of outsized power given its stature. Because of their autonomy and remarkable intelligence, soulbound dolls are occasionally employed by their crafters as administrators over much more powerful but mindless constructs such as golems, allowing such dolls to control defenses far beyond their own capabilities. Though soulbound dolls contain a small fragment of a soul extracted during or shortly after a person's death, this doesn't affect the deceased's resurrection or progress to the afterlife. This extraction process is lethal to otherwise-living prospective soul donors, though there are rumors of more expensive processes that allows someone to donate a fragment of a living soul without repercussions.</p>\n<p>The soul fragment resides in a soul focus gem typically embedded in the doll's neck or chest. The soul fragment isn't static, and the doll continues to learn from its initial state, meaning its personality and abilities can change, possibly growing closer to the donor's or moving farther afield on its own individual path. The soulbound doll's focus gem retains the doll's memories even after the doll's destruction.

The key to understanding green dragons is to understand their obsession with knowledge and self-discipline. Any careful approach that takes advantage of a green dragon's fixations may end in a diplomatic outcome, but any misstep or slight can provoke a savage attack. Like most chromatic dragons, green dragons do not suffer fools-and the threshold for what they consider foolish is very low.</p>\n<p>Though more open than their chromatic cousins to dealing with other creatures and dragons, green dragons prefer an isolated and quiet life. They tend to lair in the most forbidding parts of a forest, surrounded by tangled thickets, or else at the heart of some dismal gulch. If the terrain is suitable, some green dragons make their home in natural caves, which they expand to suit their needs.</p>\n<p>Green dragons' pride leads them to see to the preservation of their forest homes. They feel that a verdant and lush forest is something that they alone have cultivated. This leads some green dragons to follow the path of druidism, though most prefer to study the arcane arts and occult lore. Most of them delve deeply into one particular field of study, and correspond with other scholars in the field by adopting a pen name that hides their true nature. Regardless of their chosen focus, green dragons seek to improve themselves, and their desire for knowledge makes them more likely to deal diplomatically with other creatures in order to obtain new information.</p>\n<p>Their hoards are typically well kept, organized, and filled with tomes of lore and scrolls of magic along with antiquities they collect for their own inscrutable reasons. Many of these treasures come from across the globe, and many an adventurer has survived an encounter with a green dragon by stroking its ego and plying it with rare artifacts or lost lore from ancient cultures.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty-be it by claw, tooth, or breath-and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":16,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"},{"acuity":"imprecise","range":60,"type":"scent"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":16},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":16},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":17}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":13},"arcana":{"base":16},"athletics":{"base":17},"deception":{"base":14},"diplomacy":{"base":16},"intimidation":{"base":16},"nature":{"base":14},"occultism":{"base":17},"society":{"base":14},"stealth":{"base":15}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"lg"},"value":["amphibious","dragon","evil","lawful"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.xZQIChzzIYbNIEoT"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"YPLZkAlOuaj3F3nZ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"2iGIMuumKfirLAzh","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Arcane Innate Spells","sort":100000,"system":{"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null},"description":{"value":""},"prepared":{"flexible":false,"value":"innate"},"proficiency":{"value":0},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"slots":{},"slug":null,"spelldc":{"dc":28,"mod":0,"value":20},"tradition":{"value":"arcane"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"spellcastingEntry","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"s1EiBDZD5WaFxheZ","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.QnTtGCAvdWRU4spv"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/detect-alignment.webp","name":"Detect Alignment (Evil Only)","sort":200000,"system":{"area":{"type":"emanation","value":30},"cost":{"value":""},"counteraction":false,"damage":{},"defense":null,"description":{"value":"<p>Your eyes glow as you sense aligned auras.

Although they typically make their lairs among the highlands, the pursuit of justice leads silver dragons to travel far and wide-often into the very heart of realms overrun by evil. These exemplars of righteousness are ceaseless in their determination to help the weak, spread honor, and stamp out evil.</p>\n<p>Silver dragons are sleek and sinuous. Their hides resemble nothing so much as a suit of gleaming armor, lending further credence to the popular myth that silver dragons are the paladins of dragonkind. The zeal with which they seek out, confront, and defeat evil is unsurpassed even among their metallic cousins, and they adhere to strict codes of honor usually passed down from parent to hatchling. On occasion, they instead learn these codes from trusted mentors, usually other silver dragons or gold dragons. As they age, they become even more dedicated to their codes, often adding new and even more restrictive clauses to the systems that guide their behavior.</p>\n<p>Silver dragons are incredibly altruistic and regularly consort with the citizens of goodly societies, of which they consider themselves protectors and guides. In addition to responding to evil threats, silver dragons work to prevent evil from taking root in the first place, and they ensure mortals under their care are well fed, educated, and treated with dignity. Although silver dragons can seem overzealous or even eager to join the fight against evil, they know that the best way to rid the world of corruption is to stamp out strife and disillusionment at their source, not to passively sit back and watch it grow into an unsolvable problem. Silver dragons can be vindictive, but they can also be forgiving; for evildoers who seek to atone for their sins and turn over a new leaf, the support of a silver dragon is both unwavering and invaluable.</p>\n<p>Many silver dragons are also drawn to religious endeavors, venerating deities such as Iomedae, Sarenrae, and other deities concerned with justice, virtue, and redemption.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals' lives-and of their passing-always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don't seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water-though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other.</p>\n<p>In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts, other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes. Countless other types of dragons are sure to exist, including dragons on far-flung planes of existence and, it is rumored, primeval dragons who soar between the stars.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"fog vision","mod":20,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"},{"acuity":"imprecise","range":60,"type":"scent"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":20},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":17},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":21}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":14},"athletics":{"base":22},"diplomacy":{"base":18},"intimidation":{"base":20},"medicine":{"base":20},"religion":{"base":18},"society":{"base":14}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"lg"},"value":["cold","dragon","good","lawful"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.YPLZkAlOuaj3F3nZ"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"yq1BgQi0BsAMbU69","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"qhS5ZEJcqNFytqWd","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Jaws","sort":100000,"system":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"custom":"","value":[]},"bonus":{"value":13},"damageRolls":{"l62r53xvi5fa93emftw4":{"damage":"2d8+3","damageType":"piercing"}},"description":{"value":""},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":"jaws","traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["unarmed"]},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"melee","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"cprgu1LyMWRqzI0w","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Claw","sort":200000,"system":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"custom":"","value":[]},"bonus":{"value":13},"damageRolls":{"igj8v3sf65ku76csurok":{"damage":"2d6+3","damageType":"slashing"}},"description":{"value":""},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["agile","unarmed"]},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"melee","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"DsvyLX53TeuZHMQ3","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Reaction.webp","name":"Clawed Feet","sort":300000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"reaction"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"defensive","description":{"value":"<p><strong>Trigger</strong> The gargoyle is Swimming, and a creature moves into an adjacent square below it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The gargoyle makes a claw Strike against the triggering creature.</p>"},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["attack"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"action","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"9bomxaBEHSLvRrkq","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/OneAction.webp","name":"Statue","sort":400000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"action"},"actions":{"value":1},"category":"offensive","description":{"value":"<p>Until the next time it acts, the gargoyle appears to be a statue.

This heat can melt weapons, scorch armor, and burn flesh-all tactics the remorhaz uses to disable and defeat its foes. A remorhaz's internal fire allows it to burrow through ice and snow with ease. It leaves smooth tunnels in its wake as melted ice refreezes to leave the telltale signs of its passage. Most people underestimate a remorhaz's intelligence, assuming it to be a mere animal. However, remorhazes are capable of learning languages. Frost giants in particular use this trait to form alliances with them. The giants provide food, protection, and shelter for the worm, and in return the remorhaz acts as a guard beast and helps the giants build fortresses and forge metal weapons.

Victims are taken to rancid lairs marked with strange runes and sacrificed to the gugs' wicked gods of blood, darkness, and nightmares.

When the alghollthus retreated from the world, they abandoned teeming hordes of ulatkinis. Although these erstwhile soldiers tried to continue their conquering ways, their numbers declined rapidly in battlefield defeats and purposeful exterminations enacted by their enemies. Ulat-kini society degenerated, so that now only a few enclaves exist in the depths of the earth or along isolated coastlines.

Their empires contained countless mortal slaves treated as little more than cattle. Alghollthus shaped their slaves and other creatures using mental manipulation and physically transformative magic. Aberrant horrors from faceless stalkers to mimics can be traced back to this meddling. The rulers of the alghollthu race, the so-called veiled masters, further shaped entire societies by assuming the forms of those they controlled. From the heights of power to the shadows of poverty, the veiled masters manipulated these societies according to their own dark designs, enslaving, killing, or horrifically transforming those who discovered their plans or acted against them.</p>\n<p>In time, the alghollthus grew frustrated with their increasingly upstart slave societies and sought to wipe the slate clean-both starting anew and punishing those who had become too willful and rebellious. They used incredible magical power to call forth a cataclysm, hoping to destroy the rebellious societies they'd manipulated. Yet they miscalculated the strength of faith and will to survive of their pawns and slaves, and in time the world and its empires recovered and grew strong once again-this time without alghollthu influence.</p>\n<p>Today, the alghollthus have retreated from their mass-scale manipulation of the surface world, and they have mostly remained within the deep aquatic realms where they still rule without question. Yet they have not abandoned their plots entirely, and the reemergence of servitor races like ugothols points to a frightening possibility-that the alghollthus have turned their hateful eyes to the surface once again.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":6,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"}]},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":7},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":7},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":4}},"skills":{"athletics":{"base":8},"intimidation":{"base":4},"stealth":{"base":7}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"med"},"value":["amphibious","evil","humanoid","lawful"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.ZSQ4M8qeAv4dkLq1"},"effects":[]},{"_id":"ZXbr1ke1vF0ZFKY3","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","items":[{"_id":"OjJQfX1hTXQZsKNH","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Jaws","sort":100000,"system":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"custom":"","value":[]},"bonus":{"value":21},"damageRolls":{"ty73jn2tool410ddr32b":{"damage":"2d12+12","damageType":"piercing"}},"description":{"value":""},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":"jaws","traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["unarmed"]},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"melee","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"VBQJPk4ZTjKYg7E1","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/melee.svg","name":"Strand","sort":200000,"system":{"attack":{"value":""},"attackEffects":{"custom":"","value":["sticky-strand"]},"bonus":{"value":23},"damageRolls":{},"description":{"value":""},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["reach-50"]},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"melee","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"vJxCPyKdG9Aaedkx","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.bestiary-ability-glossary-srd.Item.kquBnQ0kObZztnBc"},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Passive.webp","name":"+2 Status to All Saves vs. Magic","sort":300000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"defensive","description":{"value":""},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[{"key":"FlatModifier","predicate":["item:magical"],"selector":"saving-throw","type":"status","value":2}],"slug":"1-status-to-all-saves-vs-magic","traits":{"rarity":"common","value":[]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"action","effects":[]},{"_id":"E0hXra1OswZG4gQM","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Reaction.webp","name":"Reactive Lash","sort":400000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"reaction"},"actions":{"value":null},"category":"defensive","description":{"value":"<p><strong>Trigger</strong> A creature within reach of the roper's strand leaves a square during a move action it's using.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The roper makes a strand Strike against the triggering creature.</p>"},"publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":[]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"action","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":null},"effects":[]},{"_id":"DZQzqTM8bO1vt4ps","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/OneAction.webp","name":"Extend Strands","sort":500000,"system":{"actionType":{"value":"action"},"actions":{"value":1},"category":"offensive","description":{"value":"<p>The roper extends or retracts six thin, sticky tendrils from its body.

dragons are the most contemplative of the chromatic dragons as well as the most approachable. The key to understanding green dragons is to understand their obsession with knowledge and self-discipline. Any careful approach that takes advantage of a green dragon's fixations may end in a diplomatic outcome, but any misstep or slight can provoke a savage attack. Like most chromatic dragons, green dragons do not suffer fools-and the threshold for what they consider foolish is very low.</p>\n<p>Though more open than their chromatic cousins to dealing with other creatures and dragons, green dragons prefer an isolated and quiet life. They tend to lair in the most forbidding parts of a forest, surrounded by tangled thickets, or else at the heart of some dismal gulch. If the terrain is suitable, some green dragons make their home in natural caves, which they expand to suit their needs.</p>\n<p>Green dragons' pride leads them to see to the preservation of their forest homes. They feel that a verdant and lush forest is something that they alone have cultivated. This leads some green dragons to follow the path of druidism, though most prefer to study the arcane arts and occult lore. Most of them delve deeply into one particular field of study, and correspond with other scholars in the field by adopting a pen name that hides their true nature. Regardless of their chosen focus, green dragons seek to improve themselves, and their desire for knowledge makes them more likely to deal diplomatically with other creatures in order to obtain new information.</p>\n<p>Their hoards are typically well kept, organized, and filled with tomes of lore and scrolls of magic along with antiquities they collect for their own inscrutable reasons. Many of these treasures come from across the globe, and many an adventurer has survived an encounter with a green dragon by stroking its ego and plying it with rare artifacts or lost lore from ancient cultures.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>While there are many types of dragons, from the powerful planar dragons to the strange esoteric dragons, few dragon varieties are as well-known and as rightly feared as the chromatic dragons. Differentiated by the hue of their scales, each color of dragon unleashes its own flavor of murderous cruelty-be it by claw, tooth, or breath-and unlike most creatures, dragons only become more powerful as they age. Their lust for treasure, food, bloodshed, and control are legendary. Physically powerful with egos to match, these dragons are often morally depraved and act as criminal masterminds, vicious tyrants, or voracious raiders.</p>","publication":{"license":"OGL","remaster":false,"title":"Pathfinder Bestiary"}},"initiative":{"statistic":"perception"},"perception":{"details":"","mod":22,"senses":[{"type":"darkvision"},{"acuity":"imprecise","range":60,"type":"scent"}]},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":20},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":22},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":23}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"base":19},"arcana":{"base":22},"athletics":{"base":24},"deception":{"base":19},"diplomacy":{"base":23},"intimidation":{"base":23},"nature":{"base":20},"occultism":{"base":24},"society":{"base":22},"stealth":{"base":21}},"traits":{"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"huge"},"value":["amphibious","dragon","evil","lawful"]},"_migration":{"version":0.94,"previous":null}},"type":"npc","_stats":{"coreVersion":"13.345","systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"7.2.1","compendiumSource":"Compendium.pf2e.pathfinder-bestiary.Actor.zXi6UhZ0mXWpKk4A"},"effects":[]}]
