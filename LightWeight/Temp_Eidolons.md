# Eidolons
Though each eidolon is a unique creature and there are many types of eidolons, each draws upon a particular tradition of magic and manifests from related essence. Multiple types of each eidolon exist as well—for instance, the types of construct eidolon presented in this book are the warrior construct and the scout construct. Arcane eidolons are usually formed of mental essence, also known as astral essence. They include dragon eidolons—the echoes of ancient dragons— and construct eidolons, beings formed into a simple construct shape through arcane magic. Divine eidolons are always formed of spiritual essence, much like the divine servitors they resemble. They include representatives of the many families of divine servitors, such as angels, demons, and psychopomps. Occult eidolons are also usually formed of spiritual essence, though they tend toward a more ectoplasmic consistency than divine eidolons. Occult eidolons usually form from the essence of a spirit that is unwilling or unable to pass on, and find refuge with a summoner to avoid becoming undead; these types of eidolons are known as phantoms. Each phantom eidolon has a connection to a particular emotion, such as the anger phantom and devotion phantom described in this book. Primal eidolons usually manifest from life essence. Their forms resemble creatures found in the natural world, such as beasts, plants, fey, or some combination.

## PROFICIENCIES
Your eidolon’s level is equal to yours. It begins with expert proficiency in Fortitude and Will saves and trained proficiency in Reflex saves. In addition, it is trained in unarmed attacks and unarmored defense. It shares your skill proficiencies. Certain class features increase your eidolon’s proficiencies.

## ABILITY SCORES
An eidolon’s ability scores depend on which array you choose, such as marauding dragon or cunning dragon for a dragon eidolon. As noted in your ability boosts class feature (page 56), your eidolon gets boosts to its ability scores at the same time you do. It also increases one score by 2 when it gains its transcendence ability.

## UNARMED ATTACKS
Your eidolon starts with two unarmed attacks. Each eidolon entry suggests some forms the eidolon’s attacks might take, but since eidolons can have a variety of body shapes, you decide the specific form of the unarmed attacks (claw, jaws, horn, fist, and so on) when you choose your eidolon. Some eidolons’ unarmed attacks might look like swords, clubs, or other weapons, even though they are extensions of the eidolon’s form. Your choice of unarmed attack determines its damage type— bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing, as appropriate. Some of the suggested attacks list a typical damage type in parentheses, but you can work with your GM to choose a damage type that is right for your eidolon. Once you decide upon your eidolon’s unarmed attacks, they can’t be changed except via abilities that specifically change them, except with your GM’s permission. Your eidolon has a primary and secondary unarmed attack. 
- Primary Attack: Choose from the following statistics for the more flexible primary attack. 
  - 1d8 damage (disarm, nonlethal, shove, or trip) 
  - 1d6 damage (fatal d10) 
  - 1d6 damage (forceful and sweep) 
  - 1d6 damage (deadly d8 and finesse) 
- Secondary Attack: The secondary attack always deals 1d6 damage and has the agile and finesse traits.

## EIDOLON SPELLS
An eidolon normally can’t Cast a Spell; however, some feats or abilities can grant it this capability. An eidolon that has spells also gains the Cast a Spell activity. It doesn’t have its own spell DC or spell attack modifier; if it needs to Cast a Spell, it uses your spell DC and spell attack modifier. If you have eidolon link spells, your eidolon shares your focus pool to cast them, though it can’t Refocus. Your eidolon can cast only spells that it gains from its own abilities. It can’t cast your spells, nor can you cast spells it has.

## READING AN EIDOLON ENTRY
An eidolon entry contains the following information, followed by a description of the eidolon’s initial ability and abilities gained from the eidolon symbiosis and eidolon transcendence class features.

### Tradition
This is the eidolon’s corresponding magical tradition, which determines the type of magic you can cast.

### Traits
All eidolons have the eidolon trait, and each type of eidolon has additional traits. They all appear in this entry. Alignment You choose your eidolon’s alignment, abiding by any alignment restrictions listed here. Your eidolon’s alignment has no impact on your own.

### Home Plane
This is the eidolon’s home plane, where it goes when unmanifested. This can help you determine the effects of abilities dependent on a creature’s home plane, such as banishment.

### Size

### Suggested Attacks
This entry suggests forms that the eidolon’s attacks might take (see Unarmed Attacks above).

### Eidolon Array

For instance, a demon eidolon can have the wrecker array, with a higher Strength and item bonus to AC, or be a tempter, with a higher Charisma and Dexterity cap. The appearance of the eidolon’s protection can be anything you choose that fits the eidolon: armor, scales, tough hide, a mystical aura of deflection, and so on. Though each eidolon has two arrays in this book, it’s possible for other varieties to appear elsewhere.

### Skills
These are the skills that the eidolon has taught you, or that you learned as part of linking with your eidolon. You are trained in these skills, and the eidolon shares this proficiency as normal for its skills.

### Eidolon Abilities
The eidolon starts with an initial ability, gains the symbiosis ability when you gain the eidolon symbiosis class feature, and gains the transcendence ability when you gain the eidolon transcendence class feature.

## ANGEL EIDOLON

Your eidolon is a celestial messenger, a member of the angelic host with a unique link to you, allowing them to carry a special message to the mortal world at your side. Most angel eidolons are roughly humanoid in form, with feathered wings, glowing eyes, halos, or similar angelic features. However, some take the form of smaller angelic servitors like the winged helmet cassisian angel instead. The two of you are destined for an important role in the plans of the celestial realms.

Though a true angel, your angel eidolon’s link to you as a mortal prevents them from casting the angelic messenger ritual, even if they somehow learn it.

#### Traveler’s Aura *(7th)*

Your eidolon emanates a powerful aura—resembling that of an astral deva—that protects creatures as they travel. The aura has the abjuration, aura, and divine traits. Your eidolon and its allies within a 20-foot emanation are protected from severe heat and cold, and your eidolon is never flat-footed to creatures inside the aura that are of a lower level than the eidolon.

When you gain the transcendence class feature, this evolves to the full benefits of an astral deva; your eidolon and allies in the aura are protected from environmental damage from any plane, including severe and extreme heat and cold as well as more unusual dangers.

#### Angelic Mercy *(17th)*

Your eidolon’s angelic power allows them to assuage a variety of ailments, just like most other powerful angels. Your eidolon can cast *remove curse*, *remove disease*, *remove fear*, and *remove paralysis* once per day each as 9th-level divine innate spells.

## ANGER PHANTOM EIDOLON

Your eidolon is a lost soul, bound to the mortal world by undying anger or a bitter grudge. Most phantom eidolons are humanoids with a spectral or ectoplasmic appearance, though some take far stranger forms. Your link with your eidolon prevents it from succumbing to corruption and undeath. Together, you will need to decide whether to work with your eidolon to control its anger, or channel its wrath into power.

**SEETHING FRENZY** \[one-action]
**Traits** [CONCENTRATE, EIDOLON, EMOTION, MENTAL]
Your eidolon’s fury boils over into a reckless, out-of-control frenzy. While frenzied, your eidolon is affected by *boost eidolon* and gains temporary Hit Points equal to your level, but it takes a –2 penalty to AC. It can’t voluntarily end the frenzy or start another while frenzied. The frenzy lasts for 1 minute, after which it’s fatigued for 1 minute and can’t start another for 1 minute.

#### Anger Aura *(17th)*

Your eidolon exudes wrath in an aura around it, rousing the ire of nearby creatures and causing their defenses to crack as they seethe with rage. Your eidolon gains a 20-foot anger aura, which has the **aura**, **emotion**, **enchantment**, **mental**, and **occult** traits.

* The resistances of all creatures in the aura (including you, your allies, your enemies, and your eidolon) are reduced by an amount equal to 3 + your eidolon’s Constitution modifier.
* Your eidolon can suppress the aura by spending a single action (concentrate). This limits the effect to the eidolon alone. Repeating the action reinstates full effect.
* Creatures in a **Rage**, **Seething Frenzy**, or similar anger-channeling state are unaffected by the anger aura.
