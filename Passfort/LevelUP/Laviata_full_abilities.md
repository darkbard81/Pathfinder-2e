# Laviata – Features and Feats (Level 5, Full)

## Barbarian Class Features
### Rage
You can enter a rage as a single action with the **rage** trait.  
While raging you deal +2 damage with melee Strikes and unarmed attacks, take –1 AC, and can’t use concentrate actions that lack the rage trait. Rage lasts **1 minute** and ends early if you haven’t attacked or taken damage since the end of your last turn.

---

### Instinct: Giant
Your rage channels the raw might of giants. (Failing to face a personal challenge of strength is **anathema**.)

---

### Titan Mauler  
You can wield weapons built for a creature one size larger. While doing so, your Rage bonus damage rises to **+6** and you gain **clumsy 1** that can’t be removed while wielding the oversized weapon.

---

### Deny Advantage  
You aren’t flat-footed to hidden, undetected, or flanking creatures of your level or lower (or those using Surprise Attack), though they can still help allies flank.

---

### Brutality — *5th-level feature* ★ **NEW**  
Your fury turns every weapon into a killing blow.  
- Your **proficiency** with simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increases to **expert**.  
- While raging, you gain the **critical specialization effect** for melee weapons and unarmed attacks.

---

## Ancestry Features – Android
- **Constructed** – +1 circumstance bonus to saves vs. disease, poison, and radiation.  
- **Emotionally Unaware** – –1 circumstance penalty to Diplomacy, Performance, and Sense-Motive Perception checks.  
- **Low-Light Vision** – You see in dim light as though it were bright light.

## Heritage Feature – Warrior Android  
Built for battle: you are **trained in all simple and martial weapons**.
