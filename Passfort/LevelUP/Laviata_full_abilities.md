# Laviata - Features and Feats (Full Original Text)

## Barbarian Class Features

### Rage
You can enter a rage as a single action, which has the rage trait.  
When you rage, you gain the following effects:  
- You deal 2 additional damage with melee Strikes and unarmed attacks.  
- You take a –1 penalty to AC.  
- You can’t use actions with the concentrate trait unless they also have the rage trait.  
Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you fall unconscious, or if you haven’t attacked a foe or taken damage since the end of your last turn. You can’t voluntarily stop raging.

---

### Instinct: Giant
Your rage gives you the raw power and size of a giant.  
This doesn’t necessarily mean you revere giants—you might scoff at them or even aspire to slay them! You could instead seem like a giant to other people due to your exceptional strength or larger-than-life emotions and ego.  
**Anathema:** Failing to face a personal challenge of strength is anathema.

### Titan Mauler
You can use a weapon built for a Large creature if you are Small or Medium (both normally and when raging).  
If you’re not Small or Medium, you can use a weapon built for a creature one size larger than you.  
You gain access to this larger weapon, which can be of any weapon type otherwise available at character creation.  
It has the normal Price and Bulk for a weapon of its size.  
When wielding such a weapon in combat:  
- Increase your additional damage from Rage from 2 to 6  
- You gain the **clumsy 1** condition because of the weapon’s unwieldy size  
You can’t remove this clumsy condition or ignore its penalties by any means while wielding the weapon.

### Deny Advantage
You aren’t flat-footed to hidden, undetected, or flanking creatures of your level or lower, or creatures of your level or lower using surprise attack.  
However, they can still help their allies flank.

## Feats

### Emotionless (Ancestry Feat)
You take a –2 penalty to Diplomacy and Performance checks and to any checks to lie or fake an emotion.  
You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against emotion effects.

---

### Intimidating Glare (Background Feat)
You can Demoralize with a mere glare.  
When you do, Demoralize loses the auditory trait and gains the visual trait, and you don’t take a penalty if the creature doesn’t understand your language.

---

### Toughness (General Feat)
You can withstand more punishment than most before going down.  
- Increase your maximum HP by your level  
- Reduce the DC of recovery checks to remove the dying condition by 1

---

### Sudden Charge (Class Feat)
[2-actions] (Flourish, Open)  
With a quick sprint, you dash up to your foe and swing.  
Stride twice.  
If you end your movement within melee reach of at least one enemy, you can make a melee Strike against that enemy.  
You can use Sudden Charge while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type.

---

### Second Wind (Class Feat)
You push past your limits when things look bleak.  
**Trigger**: You are at 0 HP and not dying.  
**Effect**: You can immediately use Rage even if you’ve already used it today.  
If you do, you regain Hit Points equal to your Constitution modifier × your level.  
You become **wounded 1**, or increase your **wounded condition** by 1 if you were already wounded.

---

### Swipe (Class Feat)
[2-actions] (Flourish)  
You make a wide, arcing swing.  
Make a single melee Strike and compare the attack roll result to the ACs of up to two foes, each of whom must be within your melee reach and adjacent to the other.  
Roll damage only once and apply it to each creature you hit.  
Swipe counts as two attacks for your multiple attack penalty.  
If you’re using a weapon with the sweep trait, its modifier applies to all your Swipe attacks.

---

### Titan Wrestler (Skill Feat)
You can attempt to Disarm, Grapple, Shove, or Trip creatures up to two sizes larger than you.  
You can also Grapple creatures up to three sizes larger than you if you’re raging.

### Quick Jump (Skill Feat)
You can High Jump or Long Jump as a single action instead of two, and you don’t need to Stride first.
