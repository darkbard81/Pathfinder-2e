## 🎖️ Spellstrike `Two-Actions`
**MAGUS**  
Frequency until recharged (see below)  
You channel a spell into a punch or sword thrust to deliver a combined attack. You Cast a Spell that takes 1 or 2 actions to cast and requires a spell attack roll. The effects of the spell don’t occur immediately but are imbued into your attack instead.  
Make a melee Strike with a weapon or unarmed attack. Your spell is coupled with your attack, using your attack roll result to determine the effects of both the Strike and the spell. This counts as two attacks for your multiple attack penalty, but you don’t apply the penalty until after you’ve completed the Spellstrike. The infusion of spell energy grants your Strike the arcane trait, making it magical.  

After you use Spellstrike, you can’t do so again until you recharge your Spellstrike as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. You also recharge your Spellstrike when you cast a conflux spell (page 40) that takes at least 1 action to cast; casting a focus spell of another type doesn’t recharge your Spellstrike.  

**Spellstrike Specifics**
- One Target: The spell targets only the target of your Strike, even if it normally allows more targets. Some feats let you affect more creatures.  
- Reach: The coupled spell affects the target using the reach of the weapon or unarmed attack.  
- Ancillary Effects: Your spell still has any non-targeted or ongoing effects.  
- Multiple Defenses: Saves or additional rolls apply as normal.  
- Invalid Target: The spell is expended if invalid or immune.  
- Variable Actions: Spell must take exactly 1 or 2 actions.  
- Metamagic: Cannot be used with Spellstrike.

## 🎖️ Arcane Cascade `One-Action` — *Stance*
**CONCENTRATE • MAGUS • STANCE**  
Requirements You used your most recent action to Cast a Spell or make a Spellstrike.  

After you wield magic, you can enter a special stance to make your attacks more effective.  

If your most recent spell before entering the stance was one that can deal damage, the damage from the stance is the same type that spell could deal (or one type of your choice if the spell could deal multiple types of damage).  
If the spell couldn’t deal damage, this stance’s bonus damage depends on the spell’s school:
- Abjuration or Evocation → force  
- Conjuration or Transmutation → same as weapon/unarmed  
- Divination, Enchantment, or Illusion → mental  
- Necromancy → negative

## 🛠️ Expansive Spellstrike
**MAGUS**  
Prerequisites Spellstrike  

You’ve adapted a wider array of spells to work with your attacks.  

When you Cast a Spell that doesn’t have a spell attack roll as part of a Spellstrike, it works in the following ways:  
- If your Strike critically fails, the spell is lost with no effect.  
- Creatures use normal defenses (e.g., saves).  
- If spell lets you select multiple targets, target only the creature you Struck.  
- If spell has an area, the target must be in it.  
- A cone or line must originate near or from the target.
