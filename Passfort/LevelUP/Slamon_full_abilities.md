# 🧠 슬라몬 Magus Class Features – *Secrets of Magic* Full Core Abilities

## 🎖️ Arcane Spellcasting `Passive`

**MAGUS**

You study spells so you can combine them with your attacks or solve problems that strength of arms alone can’t handle. You can cast arcane spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because you're a magus, you can draw replacement sigils with the tip of your weapon or your free hand for spells requiring material components, replacing them with somatic components instead of needing a material component pouch.

At 1st level, you can prepare one 1st-level spell and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.

As you increase in level as a magus, your number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increase. Because you split your focus between physical training and magical scholarship, you have no more than two spell slots of your highest level and, if you can cast 2nd-level spells or higher, two spell slots of 1 level lower than your highest spell level.

Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.

### 🔹 Cantrip Heightening

Cantrips are a special type of spell that don’t use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a magus.

## 📖 Spellbook

Your spellbook contains written versions of your arcane spells. You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less, which you receive for free.

* Starting contents: **8 arcane cantrips**, **4 1st-level arcane spells**
* On level-up: Add **2 arcane spells** of any level you can cast

## 🎖️ Spellstrike `Two-Actions`

You channel a spell into a punch or sword thrust to deliver a combined attack. You Cast a Spell that takes 1 or 2 actions to cast and requires a spell attack roll. The effects of the spell don’t occur immediately but are imbued into your attack instead.

Make a melee Strike with a weapon or unarmed attack. Your spell is coupled with your attack, using your attack roll result to determine the effects of both the Strike and the spell. This counts as two attacks for your multiple attack penalty, but you don’t apply the penalty until after you’ve completed the Spellstrike. The infusion of spell energy grants your Strike the arcane trait, making it magical.

After you use Spellstrike, you can’t do so again until you recharge your Spellstrike as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. You also recharge your Spellstrike when you cast a conflux spell that takes at least 1 action to cast; casting a focus spell of another type doesn’t recharge your Spellstrike.

### 🧾 Spellstrike Specifics

* **One Target**: The spell targets only the target of your Strike, even if it normally allows more targets.
* **Reach**: The coupled spell affects the target using the reach of the weapon or unarmed attack.
* **Ancillary Effects**: Your spell still has any non-targeted or ongoing effects.
* **Multiple Defenses**: Saves or additional rolls apply as normal.
* **Invalid Target**: The spell is expended if invalid or immune.
* **Variable Actions**: Spell must take exactly 1 or 2 actions.
* **Metamagic**: Cannot be used with Spellstrike.

## 🎖️ Arcane Cascade `One-Action` — *Stance*

**Requirements**: You used your most recent action to Cast a Spell or make a Spellstrike.

After you wield magic, you can enter a special stance to make your attacks more effective.

If your most recent spell before entering the stance was one that can deal damage, the damage from the stance is the same type that spell could deal (or one type of your choice if the spell could deal multiple types of damage).
If the spell couldn’t deal damage, this stance’s bonus damage depends on the spell’s school:

* **Abjuration or Evocation** → force
* **Conjuration or Transmutation** → same as weapon/unarmed
* **Divination, Enchantment, or Illusion** → mental
* **Necromancy** → negative

## 🛠️ Magus’s Analysis `One-Action`

**Prerequisites**: Spellstrike

You make an assessment informed by your knowledge of how a creature fights. Attempt a check to Recall Knowledge about a creature. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your check if you previously hit the creature with a Strike this turn.

If your check is successful, recharge your Spellstrike. The subject of your check is temporarily immune to Magus’s Analysis for 1 day.

## 🛠️ Expansive Spellstrike

**Prerequisites**: Spellstrike

You’ve adapted a wider array of spells to work with your attacks.

When you Cast a Spell that doesn’t have a spell attack roll as part of a Spellstrike, it works in the following ways:

* If your Strike critically fails, the spell is lost with no effect.
* Creatures use normal defenses (e.g., saves).
* If spell lets you select multiple targets, target only the creature you Struck.
* If spell has an area, the target must be in it.
* A cone or line must originate near or from the target.

## 🛠️ Emergency Targe `Reaction`

**Prerequisites**: holding shield or prepared Shield spell
**Trigger**: You’re hit by a melee Strike or fail a save vs a spell

You can immediately Raise a Shield or cast Shield.

Useful for defensive action even when surprised.

## 🛠️ Striking Spell (Level 4 Passive)

After a successful Spellstrike, if you Strike the same creature before the end of your next turn, you may cast a 1-action spell upon them as a free action.

## ✴️ Focus Spell: Shielding Strike `2-actions`

Make a melee Strike and cast Shield spell. If the Strike hits, you gain +1 AC and can use the Shield Block reaction.

While in Arcane Cascade stance with your shield raised, AC bonus applies to saves against spells. Shield Block triggers even from spell damage. Shield's Hardness increased by your Arcane Cascade bonus damage.
