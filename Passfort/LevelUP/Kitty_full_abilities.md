# Kitty – Features and Feats (Level 5, Full)

## Rogue Class Features
### Sneak Attack
When your enemy can’t properly defend itself, you take advantage to deal extra damage.  
If you Strike a creature that has the flat-footed condition with an agile or finesse melee weapon, an agile or finesse unarmed attack, a ranged weapon attack, or a ranged unarmed attack, you deal an extra 1d6 precision damage.  
For a ranged attack with a thrown melee weapon, that weapon must also be agile or finesse.  
As your rogue level increases, so does the number of damage dice for your sneak attack. **Increase the dice by one at 5th, 11th, and 17th levels.**

---

### Surprise Attack
You spring into combat faster than foes can react.  
On the first round of combat, if you rolled Deception or Stealth for initiative, creatures that haven’t acted are flat-footed to you.

---

### Rogue’s Racket (Thief)
When you attack with a finesse melee weapon, you can add your Dexterity modifier to damage rolls instead of your Strength modifier.  
You are trained in Thievery.

---

### Deny Advantage
You aren’t flat-footed to hidden, undetected, or flanking creatures of your level or lower (or creatures of your level or lower using Surprise Attack). They can still help allies flank.

You’re thoroughly familiar with your tools of the trade.  
* Gain **expert proficiency** in simple weapons, plus rapier, sap, shortbow, shortsword, and unarmed attacks.
