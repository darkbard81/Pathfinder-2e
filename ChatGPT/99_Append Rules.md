## Creature Adjustments (Howl of the Wild)

When you need to add a new twist to an existing creature or represent a close, 
but unique relative of another existing creature, consider using the following 
adjustments to quickly add thematic abilities. 

The elite and weak adjustments, which first appeared in Monster Core, are also 
repeated here for convenience.

As with any adjustments, these changes are meant to be fast and easy, but not 
comprehensive. It’s best to review whether the adjustments cause unintended 
consequences in combat. For example, many fire elementals have a weakness 
to water effects, so applying the amphibious adjustment to them would require 
adjusting their other abilities even further. On the other hand, the winged 
adjustments could cause a creature with powerful ranged attacks to become 
quite problematic for PCs or even impossible to face, especially at low levels 
of play.

### Example Types of Adjustments
- **Elite / Weak** (basic power scaling)  
- **Amphibious** (adapted to water, swim speed, aquatic traits)  
- **Winged** (flight capability)  
- **Frostbound / Sandbound** (environmental adaptation, cold or desert)  
- **Miniature / Twinned** (reduced size or duplicated body)  
- **Undead** (turned into an undead version)  
- **Aberrant** (otherworldly, mutated features)  
- **Chimera Heads** (additional animalistic traits or abilities)

## Grafting Rules (Howl of the Wild)

**Grafts** are living tissues that are implanted into a host, where they integrate with the host’s native biology.  
To implant a graft, you must be an **expert in Medicine** and have the appropriate formula.  
Graft formulas can be purchased as outlined in the formulas rules (Player Core 294).

**Prerequisites**: expert in Medicine  
- You can create and implant grafts.  
- When you select this feat, you gain the formulas for four common grafts of 3rd level or lower.  
- You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Medicine checks to implant grafts.  
- If you’re a master in Medicine, this bonus increases to +2.

### Implanting a Graft
- Implanting a graft is a **downtime activity**, using the same rules as Crafting an item (Player Core 236) except as follows:  
  - The grafter uses the **Medicine skill** to affix the foreign organ to the willing subject, who must be present throughout the process.  
  - The grafter can implant only one graft at a time.  
  - Once the grafting process is complete, the implanted subject can begin using the graft.  
- Grafts can be created from scratch, though they typically require specialized storage conditions, such as a tank of alchemical fluid, to remain viable outside of a host.

### Damaging a Graft
- Once a graft is accepted, it becomes part of the subject’s body and can’t take damage separately, just like any natural body part.  
- If a graft is ever severed from the subject’s body, it can be reconnected by any method that allows a severed body part to be reattached (such as the *regenerate* spell).  
- If the graft is destroyed before it can be reattached, the subject typically can’t restore it.

### The Graft Trait
- A graft has the **graft trait**.  
- Items with this trait are permanently affixed to the subject’s body and reduce the number of items a creature can invest each day by 1.  
- Each graft has the **invested trait** to indicate this limitation; a graft is equivalent to a magical item that the subject has no choice but to invest.  
- If a creature gets a new graft when their limit on invested items has already been reduced to zero, the graft fails to provide benefits.  
- The graft’s abilities will take effect the next time the creature’s limit on invested items is greater than zero.  
- A grafter can replace an existing graft during the implantation process or upgrade a graft into its greater version just like when Crafting a greater version of an item.
