퀘스트 제목: 부패의 숲을 넘어서 (Beyond the Rotwood)

1단계: Hook – 썩은 잎의 사도

When the party reaches the outer treeline of the Rotwood near Gallowgarden,
they find a ranger crucified upside-down on a tree, still faintly alive.

If a character attempts a Religion or Nature check (DC 20), then they identify necrotic veins infecting the bark.

If the ranger is healed or eased, then he whispers:
"The roots are bleeding... the priest walks again, but without his god."

The target: party perception is drawn to a sense of spiritual corruption and broken pacts.

목표: 도덕적 선택 유도 / 신성 타락 요소를 암시

2단계: Investigation / Travel – 균사의 길

When the party enters the forest, the ground pulses like diseased flesh.

If the party chooses the eastern trail, then each character must attempt a Fortitude save (DC 22).
On failure, the target becomes Sickened 1 and Clumsy 1 for 10 minutes.

If the party uses Survival (DC 21), then they reduce encounter frequency by half and avoid environmental hazards.

When the party rests overnight, they hear whispering voices.
If a Will save (DC 23) fails, then the target becomes Frightened 1 and cannot gain the benefits of rest.

목표: 탐색, 위험 분기, 심리적 불안 유도

3단계: Obstacle / Dungeon – 묘소의 심장

When the party enters a collapsed chapel at the forest’s heart, black vines twist around defiled altars.

If the party enters without consecration, then each living creature takes 2d6 negative damage and becomes Drained 1 (Will DC 24 negates).

If a Religion check (DC 25) succeeds, then the party learns this was once a sacred grove of a now-forsaken deity.

Enemies: 1 Rot-Sworn Ghoul, 2 Sap-Born Zombies.
The ghoul uses “Scream of Hunger” once per encounter:

Scream of Hunger (2 actions): All creatures in a 15-foot cone attempt Will saves (DC 24).
Critical Failure: The target becomes Stunned 1 and Frightened 2.
Heightened (+1): Increase cone range to 30 feet.

목표: 전투 유도, 종교적 과거와 현재의 대비

4단계: Climax / Confrontation – 부패의 제단

When the party reaches the center, they discover a crystal of fungal origin pulsing in black light.

A former druid turned Blight-Fused Wight emerges to protect the growth.

If the party removes the crystal without disrupting the ritual circle, then all living creatures in a 30-foot aura become Enfeebled 2 for 1 minute.

Rot Pulse (3 actions): Deals 4d6 negative damage in a 20-foot burst (Fortitude DC 25 for half).
On failure, the target also becomes Doomed 1 for 1 hour.

If the wight reaches 0 HP while the crystal is active, then it resurrects in 1 round unless sealed through a Nature + Religion ritual.

목표: 강한 적 + 전투 중 의식 제어 → 전술 + 역할 분리 요구

5단계: Resolution / Fallout – 귀환 혹은 씨앗

If the party seals the crystal, then the rot begins to recede from the forest and nature spirits return.
Each PC may gain 1 permanent Hero Point at GM discretion.

If the party shatters the crystal, then they prevent immediate resurrection, but a "Seed of Decay" takes root.

All Wisdom-based skill checks in nearby regions take a –1 penalty for 3 weeks.

Loot: Spore-Wrapped Talisman
Once per day, when reduced to 0 HP, the wearer rises with 1 HP but becomes Clumsy 2 and Sickened 1 for 1 hour.
