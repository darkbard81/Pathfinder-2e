퀘스트 제목: 어둠 아래, 그를 위해 (Beneath the Black Soil)

1단계: Hook – 신탁의 메아리

When the party reaches the catacomb border of deep Gallowgarden, a stagnant pressure fills the air.
A strange absence of life covers the ruins, and Aecora recalls her divine oracle: 
"Purify the jewel in land stained with darkness."
However, no such jewel is visible, and divine magic yields no result.

If a player uses Religion or Arcana (DC 21), they detect an ancient seal disrupted by necromantic bleeding.
If a player uses Diplomacy or Nature to speak with a local spirit (DC 23), they learn: 
"The heart no longer beats, but something still remembers the pain."

Goal: Introduce false expectations / instill spiritual and emotional pressure on the party


2단계: Investigation / Travel – 봉인의 굶주림

As the party explores the inner catacombs, food supplies decay or disappear mysteriously.
Animals vanish, divine food conjuration fails (GM discretion), and even rations rot mid-meal.

For each day inside, the party must attempt a Fortitude save (DC 22) or gain Fatigued.
If they attempt Survival (DC 21) or Crafting (DC 22), they can purify or secure one meal.

Optional: 1d3 random undead patrols (use Rot-Sworn Ghoul or Sap-Born Zombie variants).
If players rest inside, random party members hear voices repeating:
"You came too late... again and again..."

Goal: Build attrition stress / reinforce urgency and spiritual dissonance


3단계: Obstacle / Dungeon – 붕괴된 성좌

The party reaches the central crypt complex, heavily trapped and inhabited by minor undead guardians.

Encounters: 
- 2 Rot-Sworn Ghouls (CR 9)
- 2 Sap-Born Zombies (CR 2, corpse-triggered hazards)

If a character investigates the walls (Perception DC 23), they see frescoes defaced with a single name: "Kanaria"
A single intact mirror rests in the chamber, untouched by decay.

When the final door opens, describe a sudden shift: no enemies appear, only the faint scent of roses.

Goal: Setup final boss appearance / weaken party resources via relentless pressure


4단계: Climax / Confrontation – 칼끝에 남은 이름

Kanaria, Elite Vetalarana Manipulator (Creature 13), reveals herself at the heart of the ruins.

She appears alone, not as a monster, but as a woman dressed in blood-colored silks, standing in front of a stone altar. Her gaze locks only onto Slamon.

If Slamon is present, she says:  
"You said you wouldn't leave. So I waited. For this exact moment. Come back to me… or they will die screaming."

Kanaria attempts no manipulation or magic. Instead, she holds Aecora and Naataly in suspended crimson chains — purely magical bindings that tighten every round.

For every round the party delays:
- Both Aecora and Naataly take 1d8 damage (no save)
- After 3 rounds: Fortitude Save DC 25 or become Dying 1

If Slamon offers himself:
- Go on Step 5 Resolution / Fallout.

Goal: Force emotional ultimatum / prevent combat via sacrifice


5단계: Resolution / Fallout – 끝나지 않은 사랑

As the crimson binding tightens around Aecora and Naataly, Slamon steps forward without hesitation.

He speaks with calm clarity:
  “그만하자, 카나리아. 그 아이들은 내가 지킨다. 나만 데려가.”

Kanaria smiles without words. She releases the bindings. Aecora collapses, breathing heavily. Naataly cries out, reaching for Slamon.

Before anyone can move, Kanaria places her hand upon Slamon’s chest.
A crimson mark burns over his heart. His pulse stops.

Within seconds, his eyes dull to a deep garnet red. His skin pales, lips darken, breath ceases.

Kanaria whispers:
  “이제, 당신은 다시 내 거야.”

The two vanish into swirling red mist. No explosion, no echo—just silence.

All that remains is:
- A blackened ring on the altar
- Slamon’s journal, the last page torn
- A faint warmth in the air, as if he lingered for one second longer than needed

Escape:
- The temple begins to collapse after their departure
- All PCs must succeed Reflex DC 22 or take 4d6 bludgeoning from falling debris
- Outside, the dawn is cold. Nothing of Kanaria remains.

Reward (non-mechanical):
- Aecora gains Resolve: her Oracle is not fulfilled, but her path is now her own
- Naataly gains Drive: her music now carries a new rhythm—one of loss, and pursuit

End State:
- Slamon is gone, willingly turned Vampire
- Aecora and Naataly survive, but begin a new journey to find and possibly save him
- No other ending is possible
