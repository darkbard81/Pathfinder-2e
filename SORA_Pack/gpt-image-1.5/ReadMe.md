A female half-fairy cleric, adult woman,
semi Japanese anime style mixed with fantasy game illustration,

voluptuous and thick body type, soft but powerful curves,
full thighs and hips, sturdy yet feminine silhouette,
clean, smooth, human-like skin, healthy and radiant,
no green or gray tones, no rough or dirty texture,

gentle and confident expression,
large expressive anime-style eyes,
slightly pointed fairy ears,
subtle fairy traits, elegant and divine atmosphere,

long flowing hair, softly styled, natural dark brown tones,

cleric outfit design:
a holy robe inspired outfit but separated like a bikini-style two-piece,
upper piece: sacred robe-like top with holy runic trims,
lower piece: matching robe skirt or cloth panels, separated from the top,
clear visual separation between upper and lower garments,
ornate divine symbols and glowing holy runes embroidered on the fabric,
gold and white color scheme, elegant and ceremonial,
designed for mobility and battle-ready grace, not heavy armor,

small translucent fairy wings on her back,
softly glowing, delicate and magical,

holding a holy staff or mace with a crystal core,
subtle divine light emanating from the weapon,

fantasy lighting with soft glow,
clean lineart, smooth shading,
stylized painterly rendering,
anime-inspired proportions with game illustration polish,

background:
ancient temple ruins or a glowing forest sanctuary,
soft sunlight filtering through trees,
floating magical particles, calm and sacred mood
